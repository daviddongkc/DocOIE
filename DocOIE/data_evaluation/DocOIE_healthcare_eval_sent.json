accurate price for a product being charged to the consumer.", "It is noted that the integrated scanner/scale can be a weigh scale only and does not have to be an integrated device and still adapted

invention finds this C-beacon 205.sup.i (Figure 1; 105) and adds it to the Neighbour Hub list (Figure 1; 106).", "By alternating the inactive periods, 204 of the own Hub between two values, this illustration demonstrates that the C-beacon of the target Hub will be found if the target Hub transmits a periodical C-beacon; no matter what is the C-beacon interval of the target Hub.", "The timer must of course be set to a high enough value that the algorithm won't miss the first instance of the C-beacon within the inactive periods, 204 of the discovering Hub.", "Of course, a single C-beacon 205.sup.i hit is enough for the algorithm for adding that particular neighbouring C-beacon to a neighbour Hub list.", "It can be generally stated that alternating the inactive period improves the probability of receiving any periodic C-beacon transmissions as the varying length of the TD disrupts the constant cyclic transmission of D-beacons and shifts the relative occurrence of the inactive period scans with respect to the constant cyclical C-beacon transmissions.", "It is notable that Figure 2-3 do not present the only possible solution in varying the temporal lengths of the inactive periods.", "The algorithm works well with other values as well but Figure 2-3 suggest one of the less complex implementations according to the present invention.", "In another embodiment, the every second inactive period length can be set to have three times the temporal length of the rest of the inactive periods.", "In yet further embodiment, the temporal length of odd inactive periods is selected as a very short time period compared to the temporal length of even inactive periods (the latter having a \"regular value\", such as the length or 204, for instance).", "Of course, the roles of even and odd inactive periods can be switched with one another with no change to the inventive concept as such.", "The discovery algorithm itself is initiated by a higher layer entity of the discovering network.", "The hub knows the control channel lists but a selection of them to be included in the scan may be provided by the higher layer entity.", "The possible formats of the C-beacons to be used in the algorithm are known to the Hub.", "Summarizing the essence of the present invention, it can be generally stated that alternating the inactive period improves the probability of receiving any periodic C-beacon transmissions as the varying length of the TD disrupts the constant cyclic transmission of D-beacons and shifts the relative occurrence of the inactive period scans with respect to the constant cyclical C-beacon transmissions.", "An advantage of the present invention is that the algorithm finds the neighbouring network(s) in a quicker manner compared to the prior art because the IBI duration varies in the present invention.", "Another crucial advantage is that the present invention allows uninterrupted operations for both the discovering network and the networks to be discovered during the discovery process; meaning that both networks are already operational when the network discovery algorithm is initiated, and the networks remain in completely normal operational state during the discovery process.", "As a result, no shutdown is required for the discovering network during the algorithm or at the end of the algorithm.", "One further advantage of the invention is that it is applicable not only to Wireless Body Area Networks, but to all networks and their entities which have a control channel and a known beacon structure where the active and

flange.", "The illumination ring 30b is inclined or angled a predetermined angle .theta., such as for example but not limited to between about 6 degrees and about 10 degrees, most preferably about 8 degrees, with respect to a plane perpendicular to the axis X2.", "The cylindrical body 30a, which is a part of the grip portion, has opposite ends opened, and has an internal plate 30c inside the

tooth.", "The third occasion is when the electric toothbrush is held at about the plane level so that the bristle touches the front face or back face of the tooth perpendicularly.", "The lighting mode can be changed with respect to different occasions.", "For example, a first lighting mode can be an ON and OFF mode such that the LEDs are turned ON when the above explained target angle is detected.", "A second lighting mode can be a graduation variable mode such that the LEDs change the strength of the light (i.e., the intensity of the light) to glow brighter as the toothbrush angle reaches the target angle.", "A third lighting mode can be a blinking mode such that the frequency of ON and OFF of the LEDs becomes higher as the toothbrush angle reaches the target angle.", "In one

esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) using a hydrojet endoscopic capsule (HEC) 100.", "The HEC is maneuvered within the body of a patient using fluidic jets that expel a fluid (typically potable water) out of the main body of the capsule.", "A multi-channel soft tether provides pressurized fluid from a fluid distribution system (described in further detail below) to a set of nozzles on the capsule in order to control the thrust produced by the nozzles.", "In the example of Figure 1, the capsule is equipped with a camera and one or more LEDs for illuminating and capturing images of the interior anatomy of the patient.", "The main body of the capsule includes a plurality of exhaust ports through which the pressurized fluid medium is expelled to control the full hemispherical movement of the capsule within a workspace.", "One or more suction ports are also positioned on the main body of the capsule and are used to extract fluid from the patient's internal anatomy (for example, the patient's stomach and/or GI tract) in order to prevent over inflation of the anatomy by the fluid that is injected for maneuvering the capsule.", "In some embodiments, the capsule is equipped with other sensors including, for example, an inertial sensor.", "The inertial sensor (for example, an accelerometer) supplements manual control signals provided by a user and is used to implement closed loop control of the capsule system as described in further detail below.", "In the example of Figure 1, the capsule is inserted through the mouth of the patient and extended through the cardia into the stomach.", "In the stomach, the jets of the capsule controllably expel fluid through the exhaust ports to maneuver the capsule along the fundus, the lesser curvature, and the greater curvature towards the pylorus.", "Figure 2A illustrates the capsule in further detail.", "In the example of Figure 2A, the main body of the capsule is selectively openable to provide access to a sealed compartment inside the capsule.", "In this example, the main body is opened by detaching an outer shell front cap from the outer shell main body.", "An inner core is positioned inside the main body to provide structural support and to aid in placement of internal components of the capsule.", "The camera extends linearly from the distal end of the inner core and the LEDs are mounted on the distal end of the inner core.", "The exhaust ports and suction ports of the capsule are formed in the outer shell main body of the capsule in this example.", "As shown in Figure 2B, four exhaust ports are positioned around the circumference of the main body at 90 degree angles relative to each other.", "However, it is noted that other quantities and spacings of exhaust ports are possible--for example, a total of three exhaust ports may be positioned around the circumference of the main body at 120 degree angles relative to each other.", "Returning to the example of Figure 2A and 2B, a pair of suction ports is positioned on opposite sides of the main body at a 45 degree angle relative to the respective neighboring exhaust ports.", "In this example, the exhaust ports are positioned to provide for lateral maneuverability of the capsule.", "For example, to move the capsule to the right, water is controllably expelled from the exhaust port on the left of the capsule main body.", "To dampen the movement of the capsule, water may simultaneously be expelled from the exhaust port on the right side of the capsule main body at a lesser flow rate to counteract the thrust produced by the left-side jet.", "Similarly, to move the capsule laterally upward, water is controllably expelled at a greater flow rate from the exhaust port on the bottom of the capsule main body.", "Furthermore, in some construction, the suction ports are also controllably operated to aid in the lateral movement of the capsule by drawing water to pull the capsule in a particular direction.", "For example, referring to Figure 3, once the capsule is inserted through the cardia of the stomach (at position), the capsule may be turned towards the fundus by expelled fluid through the left-side exhaust port (relative to the reader in Figure 3).", "This left-side expulsion will cause the capsule to move along the greater curvature of the stomach towards the fundus (position).", "Conversely, controllably expelling water at a greater pressure through the right-side exhaust port causes the capsule to move to the left (position).", "Continued right-side expulsion combined with continued linear insertion of the capsule causes the capsule to move along the greater curvature, crossing the pylorus until it reaches a target position along the lesser curvature (position).", "As shown in Figure 3, the capsule has an initial range of motion that can be provided by expelling fluid within the contents of the stomach.", "However, the range of motion can be extended by contacting the mucosa (for example, at position) and then expelling fluid against the mucosa to generate thrust of the capsule.", "In some embodiments, linear movement of the capsule is achieved by pushing the flexible tether further into the esophagus of the patient to advance the linear position of the capsule and by pulling the flexible tether to retract the position of the capsule.", "However, in other embodiments, the jets used to expel fluid through the exhaust ports of the capsule are angled towards the rear of the capsule to provide forward and lateral thrust.", "Similarly, the suction ports can be angles towards the front of the capsule to assist in forward movement of the capsule by drawing water from in front of the capsule to pull the capsule forward.", "Furthermore, in addition to controllably expelling fluid through the exhaust ports to cause the capsule to move laterally, the rate at which fluid is expelled can be controlled to stabilize the capsule in a current position.", "Figure 4 illustrates an example of a control system for operating and maneuvering the capsule.", "A pump draws fluid from a water source (for example, a fluid supply tank/reservoir) and provides pressuring water to a fluid manifold.", "A series of controllable valves (either proportional or on/off valves) direct the flow of the pressurized fluid through a series of fluid supply lines to the capsule.", "Each valve and corresponding supply line provides fluid that is expelled through one or more specific exhaust ports on the capsule body.", "Therefore, the lateral movement of the capsule is controlled by operating the valves.", "A computer is used to control lateral movement of the capsule by generating output signals to valve controller circuitry, which controls the operation of the individual valves.", "The computer may control the valves in response to signals from on-board sensors of the capsule (such as, for example, the accelerometer discussed above).", "The computer may also interface with one or more user controls (not pictured) through which an operator can guide the movement of the capsule.", "These user controls may include, for example, one or more foot pedals, a joy stick, or other user interface control device.", "The computer also provides control signals directly to the capsule for operating on-capsule devices such as, for example, the LEDs and the video camera system and also receives data signals from the capsule (for example, video data from the camera).", "In some embodiments, the camera data received from the capsule through line is displayed to the user on the computer to aid in the maneuvering and navigation of the capsule.", "The electronic lines and 417 and the fluid supply lines are grouped together and housing within the multi-channel flexible tether of the capsule.", "Figure 5, 6, and 7 further illustrate various examples of the hydrojet capsule.", "The example of Figure 5 provides a modular capsule that can be selectively fitted with a variety of different tools.", "Alternatively (or in addition), the capsule system of Figure 5 can provide a low-cost disposable housing with reusable, more expensive components that are selectively connected to the capsule system and sealed within an internal compartment of the capsule.", "The example of Figure 5 includes a selectively operable capsule body with an attached multi-channel tether that provides a plurality of water intake lines and one or more electronic data/power lines.", "Exhaust ports 507a and 507b are positioned around the capsule body.", "A modular tool is placed within the sealed main body of the capsule.", "In this example, the modular tool is a video camera system and, as such, the main body is equipped with a lens 511 to enable the video camera system to capture images.", "The capsule body also includes an electrical connector coupling to connect the modular tool to the electrical data/power line.", "In reusable modular systems, the camera can be removed and replaced with a different tool/system.", "However, in disposable systems, the capsule body and the flexible tether are constructed of low-cost materials and are disposed after use.", "As such, sanitization of the capsule body is not necessary.", "Furthermore, because the more expensive video camera system is sealed within a compartment of the capsule body, the camera system can be reused by coupling the camera system into another capsule body without requiring additional sanitization of the camera system.", "In the example of Figure 6, provides another implementation with reusable component that must be sanitized between each use.", "The main body is coupled to a plurality of fluid supply lines and one or more electrical data/power lines.", "The main body also includes a plurality of exhaust ports 607a, 607b positioned around the capsule body for maneuvering the capsule.", "However, in this example, the capsule body includes a permanently affixed video camera system.", "Because the video camera system is permanently affixed, the capsule body and the video camera system must be properly sanitized before being reused.", "Figure 7 provides a further example in which a low-cost, permanently affixed camera is included in the capsule system.", "By using a low-cost camera, the resolution and image quality is reduced.", "However, the camera system and the capsule can be disposed after use; thereby negating the need for sanitization procedures which can be difficult in some environments/locations.", "The capsule system of Figure 7 also includes a disposable main body coupled to a flexible tether that provides a plurality of fluid supply lines and one or more electrical data/power lines.", "The capsule body includes a plurality of exhaust ports 707a, 707b for controlling lateral movement of the capsule and the permanently affixed, low-cost, disposable camera system.", "As discussed above, the capsule system receives pressurized fluid from an external system to control lateral movement of the capsule.", "In the example of Figure 4, water is drawn from a reservoir/tank by a pump.", "However, other pressurized fluid supply/control mechanisms are possible.", "Figure 8 illustrates an example of a fluid distribution system that controllably provides pressurized fluid to each nozzle of the capsule to produce thrust for the capsule.", "A fluid tank holds water in a pressurized/sealed vessel.", "An air supply provides pressurized gas/air that is provided to the fluid tank above the held water.", "The air supply can include, for example, an electrically powered pneumatic pump or a regulated tank of pressurized air.", "The increased air pressure within the fluid tank applies pressure to the water stored therein and pushes the water into the plurality of supply lines.", "Each supply line is equipped with a controllable pinch valve to regulate the amount of water that passes through each supply line to the capsule and to regulate the flow rate in each supply line.", "In systems that use a regulated compressed air tank as the air supply, the system can have very low power consumption requirements because no electric pump is needed to supply fluid to the capsule.", "Instead, the compressed gas, which can be carried in portable canisters, is used in conjunction with the dispensing pressure vessel to control maneuvering of the capsule.", "Because the system does not require electric power to drive a fluid or pneumatic pump, the need for external infrastructure during use is nearly eliminated, making the system more portable and potentially battery powered.", "These features make the system particularly appealing for use in developing countries and rural areas.", "In some embodiments, the fluid distribution system also includes a weight sensor that monitors the weight of the fluid tank in real-time.", "This weight measurement is then used by the computer control system (for example, computer in Figure 4) to estimate the flow rate of the working fluid (for example, the water in the fluid tank) to the capsule and, therefore, the total amount of fluid added to the patient's GI tract.", "The fluid distribution system then controls the rate at which water is drawn through the suction valve to match the volume of fluid supplied to the patient in order to maintain

located in the MRT, wherein the radiation is emitted after an excitation by a high frequency pulse.", "Corresponding to the center frequency, a receiving coil of the MRT-device is configured to receive the emitted radiation.", "For superconducting magnets, one cryogenic solution is to cool the magnet in a Helium bath where the magnet coils are enclosed in vessel in direct contact with liquid Helium.", "Most systems use around 1000-2000 liquid liters of Helium, which adds cost due to the complexity of managing the Helium inventory.", "One of the current trends for superconducting magnets is to dramatically reduce (for example, Low Helium Inventory--LHI) or remove the Helium system (for example, Dry Magnet) from the magnet.", "This has already been seen on small magnets used for NMR and animal MRI.", "Removing the Helium system presents many technical challenges and practical challenges of having such a magnet operate in a real hospital or clinic environment.", "In particular, for \"LHI and dry magnets\", where there is a probability for a breakdown of the site electric power supply and/or a breakdown of a cooling supply for the magnet refrigeration system, there is the risk of a \"quench\" where the magnet coils become resistive leading to a rapid reduction of field and warming of the magnet, leading to a lengthy recovery time and customer downtime.", "To reduce the

into a non-operating status but avoiding the lengthy recovery time after a quench.", "Once the magnet refrigeration has been restored, the magnet is transferred from the non-operating state to the operating state by re-cooling the magnet and re-ramping the magnet to field.", "However, this reestablishing of the magnetic field might result in a shift of the magnetic field established at the end

avoided.", "Additionally, it is possible to adjust the magnetic field accurately for establishing a desired center frequency matching to the center frequency of the receiving coil.", "Thereby the desired magnetic field is re-established at the end of the ramp-up mode.", "In particular, a control unit is provided for: comparing the observed reference parameter to the target value; and finishing the ramp-up mode for re-establishing the desired magnetic field.", "The reference parameter and the target value may be compared continuously during the ramp-up mode.", "In particular, in a ramp-up mode, a current causing the magnetic field is successively increased for realizing the magnetic field and in the ramp-down mode the current is reduced.", "Thereby, the current is provided by a magnetic power supply.", "Moreover, the methods refer to a ramp-up mode being initiated after a previous ramp-down mode, for example, after a previous shut down, (such as for safety reasons, for maintenance work, or for recovering a malfunction of the MRT-device).", "The phrase \"observing reference parameter different from the magnetic field\" is generic for measuring without a device being intended for measuring the magnetic field directly such as a flux meter, AC-Hall-sensor, a DC-Hall-sensor, a SQUID sensor, or a fluxgate.", "Instead, a different parameter is observer or measured.", "In certain examples, the reference parameter is only observed during the ramp-up-mode or during a defined time span of the ramp-up mode.", "According to an embodiment, the reference parameter is a current, in particular, a current for realizing the magnetic field of the magnet.", "Measuring the current that realizes the magnetic field may be established, for example, by integrating a shunt into the magnetic power supply.", "Furthermore, the current being observed during the ramp-up mode is observed anyway.", "Thus, there is no need for integration a new measuring device into the

MRT-device is operated in a ramp-up mode and simultaneously the center frequency and the current are measured.", "As soon as the desired center frequency of the receiving coil is reached, the corresponding current is measured and saved to a memory device as a target value.", "By relying on the saved target value, the control unit compares the actual reference parameter measured in a subsequent ramp-up mode to the target value saved in the memory device.", "It is possible that the previous ramp-up mode being in charge of the calibration takes place during the installation or during maintenance work.", "In an embodiment for setting the target value, the current is calibrated during a previous ramp-down mode, in particular, during the ramp-down mode preceding the ramp-up mode.", "As a consequence, the calibration is performed at a time being close to the ramp-up mode.", "This allows reducing the accuracy, repeatability, and reproduction specifications of the current measuring device at the magnetic power supply.", "Thus, a shunt may be used as a current measuring device instead of comparable expensive current transducers being more accurate and stable.", "In particular, integrating such a shunt into the magnetic power supply provides a greater flexibility regarding the locating of the magnetic power supply, because the shunt is not as sensitive to magnetic stray fields as a current transducer.", "Furthermore, requirements for the MRT-device to monitor and to store the calibration of the current measuring device are not needed in this embodiment.", "Thus, more complex procedures involving regular service or a customer involvement may be avoided.", "In certain examples for setting the target value, the current is observed during an initiation phase of the ramp-down mode.", "In particular, the current is measured immediately before the ramp-down mode is started, for example, before the current is reduced.", "As a result, the current value being the last known current value for realizing the desired magnet field is set as target value.", "This is a particular easy way of setting the target value.", "Another advantage of calibrating the target value in the initiation phase is that there is no need for a further probe that has to be placed into the MRT-device.", "In another embodiment, the current is measured by a current measuring device included into a magnetic power supply of the MRT-device.", "By integrating the current measuring device into the magnetic power supply, it is further advantageously possible to reduce a cabling effort as well as shielding effort for shielding the current measuring device.", "As a consequence, additional costs regarding the cabling and shielding may be avoided.", "According to another embodiment, the ramp-down mode is an emergency ramp-down mode.", "Thus, the calibration, for example, setting the target value, is incorporated into the emergency ramp-down.", "The current may be measured as soon as the emergency ramp-down is initiated.", "Thus, the reduction of the current may start as soon as possible.", "In another embodiment, the reference parameter is a frequency, in particular, a frequency emitted by a phantom being placed into the MRT-device.", "As soon as the emitted frequency reaches the center frequency of the receiving coil, the ramp-up is stopped.", "In this scenario, the target value corresponds to the center frequency of the receiving coil.", "Thus, only a phantom or a probe needs to be located into the MRT-device.", "The ramp-mode may be interrupted and establish a magnetic field lower than the desired magnetic field.", "Subsequently, the phantom is located in the MRT-device and the ramp-mode is continued.", "As a consequence, the beginning of the ramp-mode may be performed without a phantom, for example, in a unattended state of the MRT-device such as overnight.", "In particular, the phantom, (for example, a PTAB phantom), is placed, (for example, automatically placed), into the MRT-device before the ramp-up mode starts or during the ramp-up mode.", "By automatically placing the phantom, it is guaranteed that the position of the phantom is repeatable and there is no interference by an operator necessary.", "According to another embodiment, the target set is reset after a predefined period of time, in particular, automatically.", "As a consequence, the target value is refreshed from time to time taking into account an aging of the current measuring device, for instance.", "In another embodiment, the ramp-down mode is initiated by a control unit by: a failure message of the MRT-device (particularly with regard to any failure impacting the magnet refrigeration), after a defined time sequence,

magnetic field temporarily is applied to a patient or a probe, such as a phantom, at an appropriate center frequency.", "As a consequence, excited hydrogen atoms emit a radio frequency signal, which is measured by a receiving coil.", "A high frequency amplifier may be provided for covering a frequency band surrounding the center frequency for taking into account a frequency shift caused by a thickness of the probe, (for example, the patient), being measured.", "However, a transmission performance strongly depends on deviation of the emitted frequency from the desired center frequency being optimized for the receiving coil, in particular, in the case of magnetic fields being less than 1 T or 0.5 T, due to reflection effects.", "These reflection effects are, in particular, a result of a reduced conductivity of tissue, (for example, human tissue), for low center frequencies that are assigned to small magnetic fields.", "As a result, at the receiving coil, losses caused by the patient are smaller and the reflection factor changes more strongly compared to system using higher magnetic fields.", "Another problem is the different reflection factors being respectively assigned to parts of the receiving coil and resulting in a reduced transmission performance.", "Thus, a mismatch between the center frequency caused by the magnetic field and the center frequency of the receiving coil may be avoided.", "However, the magnetic field determining the center frequency decreases over time or is adjusted inaccurately by an automatic ramp-up mode transferring the magnet from a non-operating state in an operating state.", "Such an automatic ramp-up mode follows a ramp-down mode, which may be needed for \"dry magnets\" having a high probability for shutting down due to a malfunction of a cooling and/or due to a power failure.", "According to the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the magnet field is re-established after a ramp-down mode in the ramp-up mode transferring the magnet from the non-operating state to the operating state.", "A functionality of the MRT-device such as a cooling mechanism or a current supply may be recovered 15 in the time between finishing the ramp-down mode and starting the ramp-up mode.", "For adjusting the proper magnetic field corresponding to the desired center frequency being optimized for the receiving coil observing a reference parameter is provided, in particular, measured.", "Such a reference parameter might be a current or a frequency.", "Furthermore, setting a target value for the reference parameter is provided.", "By comparing the observed reference parameter to the target value, it is possible to finish the ramp-up mode, when the reference parameters corresponds to the target value.", "As a consequence, it is possible to control the magnetic field by using the reference parameter instead of measuring the magnetic field directly.", "Thus, adjusting the magnetic field may be done without expansive devices for measuring the magnetic field.", "In Figure 2, a flow diagram illustrating a method for adjusting a center frequency of a magnetic resonance tomography device according to a second embodiment is shown.", "In the embodiment presented in Figure 2, the reference parameter is a frequency, for example, the frequency emitted by a phantom being exposed to the magnetic field and the high frequency

phantom, the phantom is placed8 into the MRT-device, (for example, inside the magnet), before the ramp-up mode is started or the ramp-down mode is finished.", "It is also conceivable that the phantom, (for example, a PTAB phantom), is placed automatically at the proper spot for the ramp-up mode that is intended to adjust the desired magnet field.", "It is also conceivable that the ramp-up mode starts and the observing of the reference value starts when an approximated magnetic field below the target magnetic field is reached.", "Subsequently, the phantom is placed and the ramp-up mode is continued, in particular, by incrementally increasing the magnetic field, until the phantom emits the center frequency.", "Thus, a part of the ramp-up mode may be performed without a phantom, for example, during the night.", "In the embodiment presented in Figure 3 or 5, the reference parameter is a current, in particular, the current used for establishing the desired magnet field.", "The current may be measured by a shunt integrated to a magnetic power supply providing the current for realizing the desired magnetic field.", "In this scenario, the target value corresponds to the current establishing the desired magnetic field and the ramp-up mode is finished as soon as the target value, (for example, the target current), is reached.", "The method includes setting the target value, for example, by a calibration process.", "In Figure 4, setting the target value by a calibration process or calibration mode during a ramp-up mode or a ramp-down mode is shown.", "For example, the setting of the target value by the calibration process is performed during the installation of the MRT device or the target value is refreshed by repeating the calibration process after a determined set of time, for example, each sixth month.", "For calibrating, the frequency is observed 29 in a calibration mode.", "As soon as the frequency reaches the desired center frequency, the current is measured 32 and saved to a memory device.", "The saved current value represents the set target value.", "By refreshing the target value, it is advantageously possible to take into account that the current measuring device ages.", "Thus, the center frequency is maintained at its optimum level.", "In Figure 5, a block diagram is shown illustrating a method for adjusting the magnetic field in a MRT-device according to a fourth embodiment.", "Similar to the embodiment of Figure 4, the reference parameter is the current, in particular, the current in a shunt integrated to the magnetic power supply.", "In contrast to the embodiment of Figure 4, the target value is set during an emergency ramp-down mode.", "In particular, the current is measured in the initial phase of the ramp-down-mode, for example, before the current is decreased for shutting down the MRT-device.", "As a result, it is possible to re-establish the magnet field by using the last known current value that established the proper magnetic field before the emergency ramp down mode.", "Thus, in a simple and efficient way the magnetic field is reset accurately and complex procedures involving regular service visits or customer involvements, such as placing the phantom into the MRT-device, are avoided.", "In Figure 5, a circuit diagram for a MRT-device is schematically shown.", "In particular, the current for the magnet of the MRT device is provided by a magnetic power supply.", "Further, the circuit diagram includes diodes being connected in parallel.", "For measuring the current used for establishing the magnet field of the magnet a shunt is provided.", "The shunt may be integrated between the diodes and the magnet.", "The observed current is transferred to a control unit.", "The

states has been difficult to measure and integrate in a treatment.", "Various magnetic resonance imaging methods have been evaluated in research which may be of significance to diagnostics and differential diagnostics as well as to treatment monitoring.", "Four magnetic resonance imaging methods are briefly presented here.", "Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (resting-state fMRI or rsfMRI) determines by means of BOLD-EPI data the connectivity between individual areas of the brain which are functionally connected to each other.", "These different areas of the brain are called resting state networks and communicate with each other, such as, for example, the amygdala as the center of emotional processing, the thalamus as the hub for the distribution of sensory input, the hippocampus as short-term memory and learning or the prefrontal cortex for conscious planning and control.", "There are clear indications that the resting state fMRI method is suitable for the single diagnosis of patients, i.e. the rs-fMRI method has the stability and robustness required for a clinical application.", "Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) is a method of magnetic resonance imaging in which the perfusion in the human tissue is measured with an endogenous tracer--i.e. non-invasively.", "ASL is based on the fact that the proton spins in the blood of the arteries are magnetically marked upstream to the imaging layer.", "ASL is also used for example to measure a local increase in the blood perfusion in individual regions of the brain.", "Morphometric methods in turn aim at measuring the size of different regions of the brain.", "Treatments such as the administering of SSRIs have the effect for example of increasing the size of the amygdala, and this, in turn, can be associated with emotional recovery.", "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is also used to determine conclusions about abnormal changes in individual areas of the brain.", "The object of the

examination centers can access the data if, for example, the follow-up examination is carried out in a different hospital.", "One example from the field of psychiatric diseases should clarify the mode of operation of the invention.", "In a first examination a reduced connectivity strength S1 between two regions of the brain is established by means of resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and, moreover, the volume of the amygdala is measured at a number V1.", "In a follow-up examination, for example after four weeks, the magnetic resonance data is calibrated patient--specifically in a

expert system is therefore connected to the data memory, and this automatically determines and statistically evaluates correlations of biomarkers and for example treatment success.", "The expert system can be implemented by Bayesian networks or support vector machines.", "The advantage of such complex evaluations lies in particular in that models for courses of treatment can be created in a course of treatment module and be continually unproved on the basis of a great deal of different data.", "The models can be stored in the course of treatment module or in the data memory or even an additional data memory (not shown).", "With the aid of the models the course of treatment module determines probabilities of success of a certain treatment for future patients on the basis of current

or any other suitable battery chemistry).", "The battery is removably supported in a battery compartment defined by the body.", "In Figure 1, the battery is shown in an inserted position, in which the battery is fully received within the battery compartment and supplies power to the components of the mobile device.", "As will be discussed below in greater detail, the device includes a staged battery latching mechanism enabling removal of the battery from the inserted position shown in Figure 1 in two distinct stages.", "In a first stage, shown in Figure 2, the battery is partially ejected from the battery compartment via activation of a primary actuator supported by the body (as well as a matching actuator on an opposite side of the mobile device and therefore not visible in Figure 2).", "The battery is, however, prevented from fully ejecting from the mobile device until another actuator, supported by the battery itself, is activated.", "Following activation of the actuator (as

latching mechanism will be discussed in greater detail.", "Figure 4 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the mobile device as shown in Figure 3 (i.e. without the battery), at the section plane F4.", "As seen in Figure 4, the battery compartment includes an open rear end, and an opposing closed front end.", "In particular, the front end of the compartment is defined by a wall bearing a set of contacts.", "In the present example, the contacts, which electrically connect the battery to the internal components of the mobile device when the battery is fully inserted into the compartment, are pogo pins.", "The contacts therefore bias the battery towards the ejected position (i.e. away from the wall).", "The battery compartment also includes a set of walls extending between the front wall and the open rear end to form the compartment.", "In particular, the walls include opposing side walls 416-1 and 416-2 defining the sides of the compartment between the open rear and the front wall.", "At least one of the side walls includes a pair of latch stops.", "In the illustrated example, each side wall includes first and second latch stops.", "Thus, the side wall 416-1 includes a first latch stop 420-1 and a second latch stop 424-1, while the side wall 416-2 includes a first latch stop 420-2 and a second latch stop 424-2.", "The latch stops and 424 extend into the compartment from the side walls.", "Each pair of latch stops (that is, the pair consisting of latch stops 420-1 and 424-1, and the pair consisting of latch stops 420-2 and 424-2) is configured to engage a corresponding latch structure on the battery itself, as will be discussed in greater detail below.", "The above-mentioned actuators are also shown in Figure 4.", "In particular, the mobile device includes two actuators 200-1 and 200-2 disposed on opposing sides of the device housing (specifically the body).", "The actuators are movable between a resting position, shown in Figure 4, and an activated position, in which the actuators extend into the compartment adjacent to the first latch stops 420-1 and 420-2.", "In the present example, the actuators are buttons exposed to the exterior of the mobile device to permit the actuators to be pressed by an operator to move the actuators from the resting position to the activated position.", "The actuators extend through respective apertures in the body of the device housing, and are mounted on respective flexible plates 428-1 and 428-2.", "The flexible plates 428-1 and 428-2 are affixed to the side walls 416-1 and 416-2, respectively at rear ends thereof, and carry the actuators 200-1 and 200-2, respectively, at forward ends thereof.", "Pressure exerted on an actuator therefore deforms the plate carrying the actuator, and moves the actuator into the compartment.", "Release of the above-mentioned pressure permits the actuator to return to the resting position (for example the plates may be biased towards the resting position).", "In other examples, the actuators may be movably supported by the body by other suitable mechanisms, such as coil springs, flexible gaskets or the like.", "Turning to Figure 5, a detailed cross-sectional view of the latch stops 420-2 and 424-2 and the actuator 200-2 is shown.", "As noted above, an external force on the actuator-2, for example applied to the actuators-1 and-2 by grasping and squeezing the actuators together, deforms the plate 428-2 and moves the actuator-2 into the compartment in the direction illustrated in Figure 5.", "A strike surface 508-2 of the actuator 200-2 located adjacent to the first latch stop 420-2 therefore travels towards the interior of the compartment.", "In traveling into the compartment, the strike surface 508-2 contacts a latch mechanism of the battery and disengages the latch mechanism from the first latch stop 420-2, as will be discussed below.", "Turning to Figure 6, the battery is shown in isolation.", "The battery includes a battery housing having a rear end for insertion into the compartment and engagement with the electrical contacts.", "The battery housing also includes a rear end, which in the present example bears additional electrical contacts, for example for engaging corresponding contacts in a charger (not shown).", "The battery housing further includes side walls 612-1 and 612-2.", "Each side wall supports a respective movable latch 616-1, 616-2.", "The latches are movable between an extended position, as shown in Figure 6, and a retracted position.", "The battery housing includes, in the illustrated example, housing extensions 618-1 and 618-2.", "As will be shown below in Figure 7A-7B, the latches 616-1 and 616-2 travel into the housing extensions 618-1 and 618-2, respectively when transitioning to the retracted position.", "In other embodiments, the housing extensions can be omitted.", "As will be apparent in the discussion below, the latches are configured to engage the first and second latch stops and 424 in the extended position, and to disengage from the first and second latch stops and 424 in the retracted position.", "That is, in the extended position the latches are configured to prevent withdrawal of the battery from the compartment beyond either the inserted position or the intermediate position.", "Further, in the retracted position, the latches are configured to unlock the battery, permitting movement of the battery from the inserted position to the intermediate position (shown in Figure 2), as well as to permit complete ejection of the battery from the intermediate position (as shown in Figure 3).", "As also shown in Figure 6, each latch includes a secondary actuator in the form of an actuator surface (only the actuator surface-2 is visible in Figure 6).", "The actuator surfaces are exterior surfaces of the latches, and are configured to receive pressure (for example from the operator of the mobile device) when the battery is in the intermediate position.", "Responsive to such pressure, the latches move to the retracted position.", "The actuator surfaces can be ridged, as shown, or otherwise textured or visually distinguishable from the remainder of the latches.", "Figure 7A and 7B illustrate sectional views of the battery at the section plane F7 (as shown in Figure 6).", "Specifically, Figure 7A illustrates the battery with the latches in the extended position, while Figure 7B illustrates the latches in the retracted position.", "As seen in Figure 7A and 7B, the latches are rotatable relative to the battery housing about joints 700-1, 700-2, such as pins supported by the housing about which the latches can rotate.", "Further, the latches are biased towards the extended position shown in Figure 7A by biasing members, such as coil springs 704-1, 704-2 between the housing and each latch.", "As seen in Figure 7B, when the latches are retracted, lower edges 708-1 and 708-2 of the housing extensions 618-1 and 618-2 are visible, having been concealed by the latches in Figure 7A.", "Turning to Figure 8, a cross sectional view of the compartment with the battery fully inserted therein is illustrated.", "As shown in Figure 8, the latches are in the extended position and therefore engage the first latch stops, maintaining the battery in the inserted position.", "That is, the latches act to prevent the battery from moving from the inserted position shown to the intermediate position.", "As also seen in Figure 8, the secondary actuators (i.e. the actuator surfaces) are not exposed to the exterior of the mobile device.", "Instead, the actuator surfaces are within the compartment, and are therefore inaccessible to the operator of the mobile device.", "To remove the battery from the inserted position shown in Figure 8, two distinct stages are provided.", "In a first stage, the battery is moved from the inserted position to the intermediate position by applying pressure to the primary actuators from outside the mobile device.", "Application of pressure to the primary actuators moves the primary actuators into the compartment, engaging the strike surfaces with the latches and displacing the latches from the first latch stops.", "Disengagement of the latches from the first latch stops permits movement (for example driven by the biasing effect of the pogo pins or other biasing members) of the battery from the inserted position to the intermediate position.", "As will now be apparent, movement of the battery directly to full ejection is prevented by the second latch stops.", "In particular, when the latches are disengaged from the first latch stops, the battery moves rearward and the latches return to the extended position, as they are no longer forced inwards by the primary actuators.", "Therefore, movement of the battery is arrested at the intermediate position, shown in Figure 9, when the latches (having returned to the extended position) engage with the second latch stops.", "As seen in Figure 9, the secondary actuators (i.e. the actuator surfaces) are exposed when the battery is in the intermediate position.", "The second stage is initiated by pressing inwards on the actuator surfaces, to return the latches to the retracted position and thereby disengage the latches from the second latch stops.", "When the latches are disengaged from the second latch stops, the battery can be fully withdrawn from the compartment.", "To replace the battery into the compartment, the front end of the battery is placed into the compartment at the open rear end of the compartment.", "The battery is then pushed into the compartment until the rear end contacts the wall defining the front end of the compartment.", "As the battery travels into the compartment, the latches move to the retracted position against each of the second and first latch stops and 420.", "Such movement does not require use of the actuators or 620, as the latches and the latch stops, 424 are shaped, as seen in Figure 8, so as to permit travel of the latches towards the inserted position, while preventing travel of the latches in the return direction (i.e. towards ejection).", "In the foregoing specification, specific embodiments have been described.", "However, one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims below.", "Accordingly, the specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense, and all such

medicine.", "In general terms, in order to generate an MR image of a subject, the subject is initially placed in a strong, constant and homogeneous basic magnetic field, which causes nuclei in the subject to be aligned in the direction of the basic magnetic field.", "Radio-frequency (RF) energy is then radiated into the subject, usually in the form of RF pulses.", "The frequency of the RF energy causes certain nuclei to be excited.", "Each hydrogen nucleus represents a magnetic dipole, and expectation values of the magnetic axes of the excited nuclear spins are caused by the RF energy to deviate from the field lines of the basic magnetic field by an amount known as a flip angle.", "As these excited nuclei relax and return to the equilibrium state, the transverse components of the excited spins induce a voltage in the receive coils that is measured.", "Furthermore the received magnetic resonance signals are spatially encoded by gradient magnetic fields, and are entered into a memory as raw data.", "The raw data can be transformed into image data by a mathematical procedure, which in the most conventional approaches corresponds to a Fourier transformation.", "The image data are provided to a display monitor, at which an image of the subject is then displayed.", "In the case of medical MR imaging, wherein the subject is a patient, different types of tissue in the patient exhibit different relaxation times, and thus can be differentiated as different contrasts in the MR image.", "Two basic tissue categories in human patients are tissue predominantly composed of fat and tissue predominantly composed of water.", "These different types of tissue are commonly referred to as fat compartments and water compartments in the body of a patient.", "In general terms, however,

contribute to the total signal represented by the picture element, in an additive fashion.", "Each compartment is associated with a chemical species.", "After excitation, the nuclei (nuclear spins) start to relax back towards the equilibrium, as noted above.", "More specifically, the expectation values of the transverse magnetization and of the longitudinal magnetization decay exponentially towards their equilibrium values, as determined by the Bloch equation.", "The equilibrium value of the transverse magnetization is zero.", "The relaxation times of those exponential evolutions that correspond to the inverse decay rates are hereby referred to as T1 for the longitudinal relaxation and T2 for the transverse relaxation.", "The compartment associated with fat is known to show only

equal, and that fat does not mix in water.", "In a higher order evaluation, which can be neglected depending on the desired precision, effects such as susceptibility or transfer effects may have an influence.", "Because those effects act on water and fat compartments in the same way, they can still be considered.", "For a known fat content/fraction, the relative signal of fat thus can be modeled

species can be considered as known, such as silicon.", "In the case of determination of T1 and knowledge of the fat fraction, the T1 of the water compartment can be determined.", "Since the T1 value of fat is typically much smaller than that of water, the dependence on the exact value of T1 for fat is generally weak.", "The method can function with different types of mapping techniques, in particular inversion based techniques, such as Look-Locker, MOLLI, inversion spin echo, as well as steady state techniques such as with variable flip angles, variable repetition times (TR), as well as techniques with different contrasts, such as MESE.", "Particularly, in the case of liver diagnosis, T1 mapping is correlated with extra cellular fluid volume, which can be used as a measure or indicator of the presence of or the risk of pathologies.", "The precision of such conclusions can be improved with a T1 parameter map corrected according to the fat fraction, in accordance with the invention.", "Corrections of T1 values using a known fat fraction, wherein the correction is not based on detailed modeling, but is instead based on an empirically measured relation, are possible.",

radio-frequency pulse sequence RFS includes excitation and/or refocusing pulses.", "The reception of the magnetic resonance signals then occurs with the use of the reception coils of the local coil,

Array of acoustical returner devices to reflect sound back in the incident direction.txt": ["The present invention relates to an array of acoustical returner devices to reflect sound back in the incident direction.", "The acoustics of a room are controlled by the room's shape and volume, as well as reflections from surface treatments and the room's contents.", "Traditionally, sound absorbing and reflecting surfaces were used to control reflections.", "Peter D'Antonio introduced the reflection phase grating into the pantheon of surface treatments.", "These surfaces were based on mathematical number theory sequences and numerical optimization and uniformly scattered the incident sound over a wide range of desirable frequencies for any angle of incidence.", "The present invention teaches a new addition to the toolbox of acoustical surface treatments.", "It is based on the tri-rectangular tetrahedron geometric shape and has the unique ability to return incident sound back in the direction of incidence, like a boomerang.", "A tetrahedron is a pyramid having four planar triangular faces.", "The tri-rectangular tetrahedron consists of three mutually perpendicular faces forming a corner.", "Tri-rectangular tetrahedrons are generally known and are often referred to as corner reflectors.", "Such corner reflectors are known for use in reflecting light or electromagnetic radiation directly back to their source.", "The present invention contemplates using a tri-rectangular tetrahedron to reflect sound waves back to their source.", "Additionally, the present invention contemplates a filtering aspect that allows concentration of the reflected arrays solely to the bandwidth of the spoken word.", "This combination of aspects is not known in the prior art.", "The present invention relates to an array of acoustical returner devices to reflect sound back in the incident direction.", "The present invention includes the following interrelated objects, aspects and features:", "The power of speech is delivered in the vowels (a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y) which are predominantly in the frequency range of 250 Hz to 500 Hz.", "More importantly, speech intelligibility is delivered in the consonants (b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w), which requires information at 2,000 Hz to 6,000 Hz and above.", "If the frequencies at 500 Hz and below predominate, due to excessive reverberation, for example, these frequencies can mask the consonants and corrupt intelligibility.", "In addition, typical treatments of absorbing material on the ceiling of the room, in the form of typical ceiling tiles or fabric wrapped panels, may excessively reduce the high-frequency consonant sounds and result in the masking of high-frequency consonants by low-frequency vowel sounds.", "Simply adding large amounts of high frequency absorption to the room to achieve short reverberation times also leads to reduced Signal to Noise (SNR) values and degraded speech intelligibility, due to reduced sound levels.", "The ceiling area is very important to provide useful early reflections.", "Therefore, this invention describes a method to not only filter the voice frequencies to enhance speech intelligibility, but also redirects the important early reflections back to their source, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and speech intelligibility, to provide passive amplification and reduce interference to neighboring locations.", "For example, an array of acoustical returners in accordance with the teachings of the present invention can be combined with sound absorbers to absorb frequencies the user does not want to have returned to the source.", "One example of such absorbers consists of rendering the returners somewhat porous so that sound waves below the desired frequency range can travel through the porosity and into an absorbing area which may include fiberglass or other sound absorbing fabrics.", "These two patents disclose differing types of micro-slits used as a sound absorber and either could be employed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.", "Acoustical returners in accordance with the teachings

sound absorbing fabric.", "With reference first to Figure 1, a chart is shown which provides the spatial response and temporal response for four types of acoustical treatments.", "Those types are reflectors, absorbers, diffusers, and returners.", "As seen in Figure 1, in a reflector, incident sound is reflected forward at an angle corresponding to the angle of incidence.", "The ideal reflector reflects as much of the sound as is possible.", "In an absorber, a percentage of the incident sound is absorbed by the absorber so that sound emanating from the absorber is reduced particularly in amplitude.", "A diffuser takes incident sound and diffuses it, preferably uniformly about a listening room.", "A returner returns the sound back to its source.", "The present invention is concerned with returners.", "Figure 2 shows a front view of a tri-rectangular tetrahedron.", "As shown in Figure 2, such a device is made up of walls having three mutually perpendicular surfaces.", "In Figure 2, those surfaces consist of triangles.", "With reference to Figure 4, the tri-rectangular tetrahedron of Figure 2 is labeled with letters, with the letters a, b and c comprising the mutually

its occupant.", "The array provides passive amplification which, to the speaker, makes it sound like they are speaking more loudly than they are speaking, which typically results in the speaker reducing the amplitude of their speech which also assists in precluding disturbing their adjacent neighbor.", "There are three main choices of materials for the array.", "A first possibility is a hard surface that reflects all incident sound back to the source.", "This is the least desirable embodiment because it reflects all the sound waves including low frequencies below the bottom frequency of speech which can cause confusion to the speaker when his or her speech is reflected directly back to them.", "A second alternative is an opaque surface perhaps made of wood or other material but covered with microperforations which receive sound waves and, in effect, filter out the low frequency sounds below the bottom frequency of speech.", "A third alternative is to make the array out of a transparent or translucent material that is covered with microslits which perform a similar sound filtering feature as is the case with the opaque surfaces covered with microperforations.", "The advantage of making the array translucent or transparent is that it can be mounted beneath a light fixture so that light can be transmitted therethrough.", "Figure 12 shows a tri-rectangular tetrahedron made of an opaque material such as wood and covered with microperforations in a desired pattern.", "The tetrahedron is designated by the reference numeral and has an apex, walls, 35 and 37

absorbing fabric such as, for example, fiberglass.", "Figure 10 illustrates how a 5 mm acrylic panel with microperforations will transmit the low frequencies, thus removing them from the source area, while allowing the higher frequencies at 500 Hz and above to be reflected back to the source direction in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, thus providing passive amplification, filtration of frequencies below the spoken word, and improved speech intelligibility.", "Figure 11 shows a graph of absorption coefficient versus frequency for a variety of materials as shown.", "Figure 11 demonstrates that as the fascia thickness is increased from 300 to 600 microns, more high frequencies are reflected, and lower frequencies are transmitted and absorbed by the porous backing, thereby adding passive amplification in the frequency range where consonants are important for intelligibility.", "Applicants note that another practical application for the array is in healthcare nursing stations in which overhead and vertical arrays can be used to confine all the noise in a local area and minimize intrusion of sound into patient rooms and other locations outside the nursing stations.", "The overhead mounted array, otherwise described as \"clouds\" can be used in transportation and hospitality reservation desks to passively amplify speech in the locality of the parties involved to increase intelligibility without the need to shout and without interfering with conversations between other guests.", "Additionally, arrays such as the array can also be used in stage shells for musical rehearsal and performance.", "In such an environment, musicians will be better able to hear themselves and diffusers can also be employed so that such musicians can hear contributions from the entire ensemble.", "Figure 14 shows an array of tri-rectangular tetrahedrons mounted surrounding a computer display.", "The user speaking while facing the display will have his
