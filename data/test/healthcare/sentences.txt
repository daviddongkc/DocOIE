The dilemma arises therefrom for the patient and doctor of weighing up the sometimes severe side effects which worsen symptoms against the long-term effect of the medication.
In this respect, at least the body is reusable, and additional components of the anti-clog suction tip apparatus that are not part of the kit also are reusable.
The anti-clog suction tip apparatus is adapted to attach to a hose at the hose attachment portion, with the hose having a suction source attached thereto.
Additional preferred embodiments of anti-clog suction tip apparatus in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention are shown in the remaining figures.
Indeed, the steps in such processes or methods generally may be carried out in various different sequences and orders while still falling within the scope of the present invention.
Furthermore, any embodiment discussed and identified as being "preferred" is considered to be part of a best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention.
In yet another feature, the ejection wire is inserted into the ejection wire channel through a wire insertion opening.
The sterile packaging in which the anti-clog suction tip apparatus is provided is opened by sterile technique in the surgical environment, and the anti-clog suction tip apparatus is removed from the packaging and placed on a sterile table to await use by a surgeon or surgical assistant.
The ejection wire includes a small ball tip at the end thereof to prevent unintended injury during use, as well as to provide an enlarged end for clearing of the suction channel when the ball tip is deployed.
Based on the foregoing description, it will be readily understood by those persons skilled in the art that the present invention is susceptible of broad utility and application.
In another variation, the biasing spring biases the ejection button away from the outer member.
In the present example the grip is a pistol grip, although in other examples the grip can have various other configurations, or can simply be omitted.
In addition, in the foregoing Detailed Description, it can be seen that various features are grouped together in various embodiments for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure.
In a first stage, the battery is moved from the inserted position to the intermediate position by applying pressure to the primary actuators from outside the mobile device.
Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale.
To replace the battery into the compartment, the front end of the battery is placed into the compartment at the open rear end of the compartment.
In the present example, the contacts, which electrically connect the battery to the internal components of the mobile device when the battery is fully inserted into the compartment, are pogo pins.
In particular, when the latches are disengaged from the first latch stops, the battery moves rearward and the latches return to the extended position, as they are no longer forced inwards by the primary actuators.
For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.
The term "coupled" as used herein is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly and not necessarily mechanically.
In particular, the front end of the compartment is defined by a wall bearing a set of contacts.
Once these quantitative parameter maps are obtained, it may be possible to identify the tissue properties and provide information to improve diagnostic assessment.
In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring various exemplary embodiments.
An increase in the size of MRF dictionary is the ultimate requirement to gain improvement in the MRF results and further in depth analysis of tissues.
The GPU based MRF implementation provides cost effective solution to reduce the execution time of conventional MRF algorithm.
Such memories may be implemented in any suitable form, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media.
However, Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF), an innovative method can quantitatively examine many magnetic resonance tissue parameters simultaneously.
The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments and is not intended to be limiting.
Then GPU is used to further reduce the computation time by introducing CUDA kernels for all the operations that process independent data.
The main advantage of the exemplary method is a significant improvement in the computation time without reducing the size of data or number of operations required in the native MRF algorithm.
When an exemplary embodiment may be implemented differently, a specific process order may be performed differently from the described order.
A series of von Frey filaments with logarithmically incrementing stiffness (Stoelting) was applied perpendicular to the mid-plantar region of the hind paw.
Chemokines are released during inflammation, and they block the signaling of opioid receptors by a process of heterologous desensitization.
Our results showed that following the induction of diabetes, rats exhibited persistent mechanical and cold allodynia (up to five months post-induction).
The results suggest that functional antagonism of multiple chemokine receptors and innate immune receptors may be treatments and medicines for pain and inflammation.
Microglia in the spinal cord dorsal horns became activated with hypertrophic morphology and an increase in microglial cell number.
Body weight and blood glucose levels were measured before and 3 days after streptozotocin injection, once a week for three weeks after diabetes induction.
Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common complication of diabetes which adversely affects patients' daily life and represents a major public health problem.
Animals were brought back to their individual chambers for mechanical allodynia testing.
Although the most potent and effective drugs are the opioid analgesics, they are accompanied by a number of serious adverse effects, and they are not very effective in approximately half of the cases of chronic pain.
Rats were habituated to the testing environment daily for at least two days before the experiments started.
The compartment associated with fat is known to show only small variations or dependencies on the surrounding tissue.
As these excited nuclei relax and return to the equilibrium state, the transverse components of the excited spins induce a voltage in the receive coils that is measured.
For a known fat content/fraction, the relative signal of fat thus can be modeled and considered in the determination of the relaxation times for the water compartment.
These gradient pulses are radiated (activated) at precisely provided time positions and with a precisely predetermined time curve during a measurement.
In a further embodiment that can be characterized as joint fitting, the fat fraction is also determined by fitting to a dedicated signal model, typically multi-echo acquisitions.
The relaxation is not free (undisturbed), but the effect of the continuous FLASH acquisitions can be considered as the signal model.
It is also possible to use multi-echo FLASH in T1 mapping, specifically in the context of the Look-Locker technique and the FLASH steady state technique.
In this scenario, the signal contribution of fat can be modeled, and only the T1 value of water is then determined, by fitting a model to the acquired data.
The MR signals are received with a local coil, which can be composed of one or more individual reception coils.
The local coil can also be used to radiate the RF signals.
Items can be shipped to remote regions or regions with insufficient infrastructure without the concerns or costs associated with temperature-controlled shipments.
The kit may further comprise a receptacle suitable for performing a nucleic acid amplification reaction for one or more sequences of interest.
The quality and integrity of the resultant PCR products were investigated by performing DNA sequencing as a representative downstream application.
The physically stable, solid lyophilised reagent provides long term stability at ambient temperature, can be dispensed in flexible formats, and is amenable to downstream manipulation.
The beads and the constituent reagents are room temperature stable and as such offer significant advantages over traditional PCR amplification workflows.
In some embodiments, the biomolecule in the composition is a protein, such as an enzyme, for example a nucleic acid polymerase.
The beads are removed from the liquid nitrogen using a sieve that ensures that beads exhibit a spherical shape with consistent diameter size and weight.
The end point of the determination is indicated voltametrically by applying an alternating current to an electrode immersed in the electrolyte.
Preferably the biological sample comprises nucleic acid and the stabilized biomolecule is a nucleic acid polymerase and the assay is an amplification reaction, such as PCR.
Ready-To-Go having Tg values well above room temperature ensure that the products can be shipped and stored without the need for refrigeration.
Such corner reflectors are known for use in reflecting light or electromagnetic radiation directly back to their source.
A person within the space or cubicle speaking on the phone or with others will have his or her words returned back to them and passively amplified with extraneous sounds filtered out.
These surfaces were based on mathematical number theory sequences and numerical optimization and uniformly scattered the incident sound over a wide range of desirable frequencies for any angle of incidence.
This is the least desirable embodiment because it reflects all the sound waves including low frequencies below the bottom frequency of speech which can cause confusion to the speaker when his or her speech is reflected directly back to them.
These two patents disclose differing types of micro-slits used as a sound absorber and either could be employed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.
It is based on the tri-rectangular tetrahedron geometric shape and has the unique ability to return incident sound back in the direction of incidence, like a boomerang.
At the same time, the array assists in preventing their speech from emanating to the next adjacent cubicle and disturbing its occupant.
In such an environment, musicians will be better able to hear themselves and diffusers can also be employed so that such musicians can hear contributions from the entire ensemble.
In an absorber, a percentage of the incident sound is absorbed by the absorber so that sound emanating from the absorber is reduced particularly in amplitude.
The ceiling area is very important to provide useful early reflections.
The dosage will vary according to the type of disorder, the disease conditions and will be subject to the judgment of the medical practitioner involved.
Unless otherwise specified, all percentages and amounts expressed herein and elsewhere in the specification should be understood to refer to percentages by weight.
