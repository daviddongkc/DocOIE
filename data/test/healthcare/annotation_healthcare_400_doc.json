DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention concentrates in wireless body area networks (WBANs).": {}, "WBANs apply to for example medical and healthcare monitoring systems in the vicinity of a human body, inside the human body, or on or in a machine body.": {}, "A WBAN can be called as a wireless network comprising wearable or mounted computing devices.": {}, "The devices can be implemented inside the body tissue, on the skin, or within an implant, or as a surface-mounted device on the body in a fixed position.": {}, "Some devices may also be carriable in the clothes of the user, in the user's hand, or mounted on a technological apparatus, for instance.": {}, "Low power consumption is essential for the WBAN devices.": {}, "Furthermore, it is important that the used devices do not pose any biological or practical harm to the user carrying these devices.": {}, "Usually the sensors in the WBAN collect physiological changes or other information present within the patient or for example his/her movement, and the WBAN sensors transmit the gathered data to an external processing unit.": {}, "In this manner, the doctor may physically locate anywhere and such a professional may access the data from anywhere through a cloud computation system.": {}, "Certain alarms can be set and triggered if a certain measurement result gives a reason to be worried, or at least, if there is a life-threatening change in the patient's measured condition.": [{"sub": "certain alarms", "rel": "can be set and triggered", "obj": ""}, {"sub": "a certain measurement result", "rel": "gives",

governs the WBANs is IEEE.": {}, "Furthermore, the ETSI technical committee \"SmartBAN\" has defined physical layer and medium access control specifications for packet-based short-range communications in WBANs.": {}, "Discussing now the general facts of the SmartBAN compliant networks, such a SmartBAN network operates in two physical channels.": {}, "The first physical channel is a control channel (abbreviated as CCH) and the second physical channel is a data channel (DCH).": [{"sub": "the first physical channel", "rel": "is", "obj": "a control channel"}, {"sub": "the control channel", "rel":

control channel is used in initializing the network.": [{"sub": "the control channel", "rel": "is used in initializing", "obj": "the network"}], "The CCH may be a distinct logical or physical radio channel.": [{"sub": "the CCH", "rel": "may be", "obj": "a distinct logical or physical radio channel"}], "The coordinating entity of the SmartBAN network, i.e.": {}, "a Hub, transmits control channel beacons (i.e.": {}, "C-beacons) in the control channel where the C-beacons are transmitted periodically.": {}, "The C-beacon may thus occur in either a distinct logical or physical radio channel.": {}, "The C-beacon is always transmitted by a Hub device.": {}, "Furthermore, there may exist multiple control channels and the Hub knows them all.": {}, "Additionally, actual data transmissions are carried out in the data channel in which the Hub transmits a data channel beacon (i.e.": {}, "The IBIs in turn can be divided in four distinct parts: Beacon Period, Scheduled Period, Control and Management Period, and Inactive period.": {}, "The three first Periods are conceptually labeled as active period.": {}, "The active period commences at the start of Beacon Period and the active period is followed by the inactive period.": [{"sub": "the active period", "rel": "commences at", "obj": "the start of Beacon Period"}, {"sub": "the active period", "rel": "is followed by", "obj": "the inactive period"}], "After the end of the inactive period, a new D-beacon is transmitted at the beginning of a new Beacon Period.": {}, "Only the Hub is allowed to transmit during the Beacon Period.": {}, "The difference between the active and inactive periods is that in the active period, the devices, including the Hub, are allowed to transmit or receive over the DCH.": {}, "The inactive period is specified as a period in time following an active transmission sequence during which the equipment does not transmit or receive over the DCH.": {}, "Regarding the definitions of the parts present in the inter-beacon interval, it is possible in another embodiment to define the IBI so that it comprises an inactive period and after the inactive period, an active period will follow.": [{"sub": "it is

(regardless of their mutual order), and a new beacon is transmitted at the beginning of a new Beacon Period.": {}, "According to the present invention and according to the notation used by the inventors currently, the inactive period stands for the portion of the IBI where devices of the network other than the Hub are not allowed to transmit or receive over the channel.": {}, "This means that the Hub is allowed to transmit and receive even during the inactive period.": {}, "It can be thus deduced that in case there is a transmission or reception in the inactive period of the IBI, the transmitting or receiving entity must then always be the Hub.": [{"sub": "there", "rel": "is", "obj": "a transmission or reception in the inactive period of the IBI"}, {"sub": "the transmitting or receiving entity", "rel": "must always be", "obj": "the Hub"}], "It is notable that this is a slightly broadened interpretation of the inactive period by the inventors compared to the inactive period determined currently in the standard [3].": {}, "Summarizing the difference between the active and inactive periods in other words, the active period stands for the portion of the inter-beacon interval (IBI) where devices of the network may transmit data or control frames, as coordinated by the respective network Hub.": {}, "The inactive period stands for the portion of the IBI where devices of the network other than the Hub are not allowed to transmit or receive over the channel.": {}, "The present invention concentrates on a discovery mechanism of a neighbour network where both the discovering network and the network(s) to be discovered are Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs).": {}, "At first, a higher layer entity requests a Hub-to-Hub discovery process and this discovery process is initiated in step.": {}, "The Hub of the initiating SmartBAN begins to alternate its inactive period duration in every forthcoming inter-beacon-interval while the active period duration is kept unchanged there.": {}, "In practice, this can be implemented by toggling between two inactive period durations in every IBI so that the inter-beacon interval duration (TD) changes 102 between two different values.": {}, "In this phase, parameters i and j are set to 1.": {}, "also the running number of the IBIs).": {}, "Next, the algorithm waits for a next inactive period in step.": {}, "At a next step, the Hub initiates a timer and while it is yet to be expired, the Hub scans for control channel (CCH) beacons of other networks during the inactive periods.": {}, "In case no neighbouring network C-beacon is found during that particular inactive period, the timer is checked 108.": {}, "This round of steps is continued until the timer expires 108 i.e.": {}, "the algorithm decides that a necessary number of inactive periods have been used to listen the neighbouring network's C-beacons.": {}, "The algorithm next moves through 110 to a next control channel \"2\" (i.e.": {}, "The C-beacons for control channel \"2\", which are discovered during any of the inactive periods while the timer is still on, are added to the Neighbour Hub list.": {}, "This round of process steps is repeated until the predetermined control channel list in step is found exhausted.": {}, "Alternatively, the algorithm can be stopped if an early termination indication has been issued by the higher layer entity upon step right after an addition has been made to the Neighbour Hub list.": {}, "A final check can be made with the Neighbour Hub list whether it is empty or whether it includes at least one discovered neighbouring network C-beacon.": {}, "If the list is totally empty, the algorithm returns a failure message such as \"No Hub discovered\" to the higher layer entity.": {}, "In case there is discovered one or more neighbouring network C-beacons, and thus, at least one neighbouring WBAN network, the algorithm acknowledges this by returning a \"Success\" message, and outputting the created Neighbour Hub list to the higher layer entity.": {}, "The active periods right after the D-beacons have mutually the same temporal lengths.": {}, "As it is shown in the illustrated example, the first and third inactive periods have twice the length of the second and fourth inactive periods.": {}, "In general, the D-beacon may occur either in a distinct logical or physical radio channel.": {}, "There can also be multiple data channels.": {}, "However, the D-beacon is always transmitted by a Hub device.": {}, "Regarding their running order, odd inactive periods have a first temporal length, and even inactive periods have a second temporal length, where the second temporal length is substantially half of the first temporal length in this example.": {}, "The target Hub transmits its C-beacons in a periodical manner, with each beacon interval between the particular C-beacons of the target Hub remaining constant.": {}, "Still, the algorithm does not know the period between the C-beacons of the target Hub; at least not before the discovery of the network itself.": {}, "The scanning periods for the C-beacons on the control channel are the inactive periods, 204 of the own Hub, marked within the control channel as \"Scan for C-Beacon on CCH\".": {}, "The third C-beacon of the control channel of the target Hub locates a bit borderline with the inactive period of the own Hub, but the fourth and the fifth C-beacons' undoubtedly locate fully within the respective inactive period,.": {}, "By alternating the inactive periods, 204 of the own Hub between two values, this illustration demonstrates that the C-beacon of the target Hub will be found if the target Hub transmits a periodical C-beacon; no matter what is the C-beacon interval of the target Hub.": {}, "The timer must of course be set to a high enough value that the algorithm won't miss the first instance of the C-beacon within the inactive periods, 204 of the discovering Hub.": {}, "Of course, a single C-beacon 205.sup.i hit is enough for the algorithm for adding that particular neighbouring C-beacon to a neighbour Hub list.": {}, "It can be generally stated that alternating the inactive period improves the probability of receiving any periodic C-beacon transmissions as the varying length of the TD disrupts the constant cyclic transmission of D-beacons and shifts the relative occurrence of the inactive period scans with respect to the constant cyclical C-beacon transmissions.": {}, "In another embodiment, the every second inactive period length can be set to have three times the temporal length of the rest of the inactive periods.": {}, "In yet further embodiment, the temporal length of odd inactive periods is selected as a very short time period compared to the temporal length of even inactive periods (the latter having a \"regular value\", such as the length or 204, for instance).": {}, "Of course, the roles of even and odd inactive periods can be switched with one another with no change to the inventive concept as such.": {}, "The discovery algorithm itself is initiated by a higher layer entity of the discovering network.": {}, "The hub knows the control channel lists but a selection of them to be included in the scan may be provided by the higher layer entity.": {}, "The possible formats of the C-beacons to be used in the algorithm are known to the Hub.": {}, "Summarizing the essence of the present invention, it can be generally stated that alternating the inactive period improves the probability of receiving any periodic C-beacon transmissions as the varying length of the TD disrupts the constant cyclic transmission of D-beacons and shifts the relative occurrence of the inactive period scans with respect to the constant cyclical C-beacon transmissions.": {}, "An advantage of the present invention is that the algorithm finds the neighbouring network(s) in a quicker manner compared to the prior art because the IBI duration varies in the present invention.": {}, "Another crucial advantage is that the present invention allows uninterrupted operations for both the discovering network and the networks to be discovered during the discovery process; meaning that both networks are already operational when the network discovery algorithm is initiated, and the networks remain in completely normal operational state during the discovery process.": {}, "As a result, no shutdown is required for the discovering network during the algorithm or at the end of the algorithm.": {}, "One further advantage of the invention is that it is applicable not only to Wireless Body Area Networks, but to all networks and their entities which have a control channel and a known beacon structure where the active and inactive periods alternate (as in the Hub of the WBAN).": {}, "The present invention can be implemented as a piece of software in the WBAN system, where the software can be executed in the controller

drawings.": {}, "The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.": {}, "The HEC is maneuvered within the body of a patient using fluidic jets that expel a fluid (typically potable water) out of the main body of the capsule.": {}, "A multi-channel soft tether provides pressurized fluid from a fluid distribution system (described in further detail below) to a set of nozzles on the capsule in order to control the thrust produced by the nozzles.": {}, "The main body of the capsule includes a plurality of exhaust ports through which

for example, an inertial sensor.": {}, "The inertial sensor (for example, an accelerometer) supplements manual control signals provided by a user and is used to implement closed loop control of the capsule system as described in further detail below.": {}, "In the stomach, the jets of the capsule controllably expel fluid through the exhaust ports to maneuver the capsule along the fundus, the lesser curvature, and the greater curvature towards the pylorus.": {}, "In this example, the main body is opened by detaching an outer shell front cap from the outer shell main body.": {}, "An inner core is positioned inside the main body to provide structural support and to aid in placement of internal components of the capsule.": {}, "The camera extends linearly from the distal end of the inner core and the LEDs are mounted on the distal end of the inner core.": {}, "The exhaust ports 111 and suction ports of the capsule are formed in the outer shell main body of the capsule in this example.": {}, "However, it is noted that other quantities and spacings of exhaust ports are possible--for example, a total of three exhaust ports may be positioned around the circumference of the main body at 120 degree angles relative to each other.": {}, "In this example, the exhaust ports are positioned to provide for lateral maneuverability of the capsule.": {}, "For example, to move the capsule to the right, water is controllably expelled from the exhaust port on the left of the capsule main body.": [{"sub": "water", "rel": "is controllably expelled from", "obj": "the exhaust port on the left of the capsule main body"}, {"sub": "water controllably expelled from the exhaust port on the left of the capsule main body", "rel": "is to move the capsule to", "obj": "the right"}], "To dampen the movement of the capsule, water may simultaneously be expelled from the exhaust port on the right side of the capsule main body at a lesser flow rate to counteract the thrust produced by the left-side jet.": {}, "Similarly, to move the capsule laterally upward, water is controllably expelled at a greater flow rate from the exhaust port on the bottom of the capsule main body.": {}, "Furthermore, in some construction, the suction ports are also controllably operated to aid in the lateral movement of the capsule by drawing water to pull the capsule in a particular direction.": {}, "This left-side expulsion will cause the capsule to move along the greater curvature of the stomach towards the fundus (position).": {}, "Conversely, controllably expelling water at a greater pressure through the right-side exhaust port causes the capsule to move to the left (position).": {}, "Continued right-side expulsion combined with continued linear insertion of the capsule causes the capsule to move along the greater curvature, crossing the pylorus until it reaches a target position along the lesser curvature (position).": {}, "However, the range of motion can be extended by contacting the mucosa (for example, at position) and then expelling fluid against the mucosa to generate thrust of the capsule.": {}, "In some embodiments, linear movement of the capsule is achieved by pushing the flexible tether further into the esophagus of the patient to advance the linear position of the capsule and by pulling the flexible tether to retract the position of the capsule.": {}, "However, in other embodiments, the jets used to expel fluid through the exhaust ports of the capsule are angled towards the rear of the capsule to provide forward and lateral thrust.": {}, "Similarly, the suction ports 113 can be angles towards the front of the capsule to assist in forward movement of the capsule by drawing water from in front of the capsule to pull the capsule forward.": {}, "Furthermore, in addition to controllably expelling fluid through the exhaust ports to cause the capsule to move laterally, the rate at which fluid is expelled can be controlled to stabilize the capsule in a current position.": {}, "A pump draws fluid from a water source (for example, a fluid supply tank/reservoir) and provides pressuring water to a fluid manifold.": {}, "A series of controllable valves (either proportional or on/off valves) direct the flow of the pressurized fluid through a series of fluid supply lines to the capsule.": {}, "Each valve and corresponding supply line provides fluid that is expelled through one or more specific exhaust ports on the capsule body.": {}, "Therefore, the lateral movement of the capsule is controlled by operating the valves.": {},

electrical connector coupling 513 to connect the modular tool to the electrical data/power line.": {}, "In reusable modular systems, the camera can be removed and replaced with a different tool/system.": {}, "However, in disposable systems, the capsule body and the flexible tether are constructed of low-cost materials and are disposed after use.": {}, "As such, sanitization of the capsule body is not necessary.": {}, "Furthermore, because the more expensive video camera system is sealed within a compartment of the capsule body, the camera system can be reused by coupling the

data/power lines.": {}, "The main body also includes a plurality of exhaust ports, 607b positioned around the capsule body for maneuvering the capsule.": {}, "However, in this example, the capsule body includes a permanently affixed video camera system.": {}, "Because the video camera system is permanently affixed, the capsule body and the video camera system must be properly sanitized before being reused.": {}, "By using a low-cost camera, the resolution and image quality is reduced.": {}, "However, the camera system and the capsule can be disposed after use; thereby negating the need for

features make the system particularly appealing for use in developing countries and rural areas.": {}, "In some embodiments, the fluid distribution system also includes a weight sensor that monitors the weight of the fluid tank in real-time.": {}, "The fluid distribution system then controls the rate at which water is drawn through the suction valve to match the volume of fluid supplied to the patient in order to maintain a net balance between fluid supplied to and removed from the patient.": {}, "As discussed above, the rate at which fluid from the supply tank is allowed to enter the fluid

allowed to move through the supply line.": {}, "Among other things, the use of a pinch valve isolates the control mechanism of the valve from water--as such, only safe plastic components contact the water that will be expelled into the body of the patient.": {}, "The main body of the nozzle/jet is coupled to the distal end of the water supply line and received pressurized water.": {}, "The diameter of the nozzle body is gradually reduced in an upper portion of the main body and curves towards an expulsion portion that is positioned at the exhaust port of the capsule body.": {}, "The

worldwide, smaller and less expensive proton therapy systems are highly desired to increase patient access to therapy.": {}, "In a proton radiation system, a gantry system alone typically weighs over 200 tons which is mainly contributed by the massive magnets installed in the gantry.": {}, "To support and precisely control the motion of a tremendous amount of weight, existing rotatable gantries

of acquiring data by providing a constant signal level over time for characterizing individual parameter of interest, a pulse sequence with varying acquisition parameters is applied in a pseudorandom manner to produce unique signal evolution or `fingerprint` for each type of tissue.": {}, "MRF has the potential to quantitatively analyze different MR parameters simultaneously as compared to conventional MRI techniques.": {}, "Therefore, when a suitable pattern recognition algorithm is used, various tissue parameters of interest can be acquired.": {}, "The most common tissue parameters that relate to diseases are the T1 relaxation time, T2 relaxation time, off resonance frequency and the proton density.": {}, "These parameters have been observed to be affected by critical

a considerable amount of computation time to match the signal evolution (fingerprint) with the samples in the dictionary and produces quantitative maps.": {}, "Thus, it is desirable to implement MRF

"Additionally, the present invention contemplates a filtering aspect that allows concentration of the reflected arrays solely to the bandwidth of the spoken word.": {}, "This combination of aspects is not known in the prior art.": {}, "SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an array of acoustical returner devices to reflect sound back in the incident direction.": {}, "(2) In an important aspect, the present invention is designed to filter out the frequencies which do not contribute to and can mask the understanding of speech (referred to as speech intelligibility).": {}, "The power of speech is delivered in the vowels (a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y) which are predominantly in the frequency range of 250 Hz to 500 Hz.": {}, "More importantly, speech intelligibility is delivered in the consonants (b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w), which requires information at 2,000 Hz to 6,000 Hz and above.": {}, "If the frequencies at 500 Hz and below predominate, due to excessive reverberation, for example, these frequencies can mask the consonants and corrupt intelligibility.": {}, "In addition, typical treatments of absorbing material on the ceiling of the room, in the form of typical ceiling tiles or fabric wrapped panels, may excessively reduce the high-frequency consonant sounds and result in the masking of high-frequency consonants by low-frequency vowel sounds.": {}, "Simply adding large amounts of high frequency absorption to the room to achieve short reverberation times also leads to reduced Signal to Noise (SNR) values and degraded speech intelligibility, due to reduced sound levels.": {}, "The ceiling area is very important to provide useful early reflections.": [{"sub": "the ceiling area", "rel": "is very important to provide", "obj": "useful early reflections"}], "Therefore, this invention describes a method to not only filter the voice frequencies to enhance speech intelligibility, but also redirects the important early reflections back to their source, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and speech intelligibility, to provide passive amplification and reduce interference to neighboring locations.": {}, "(3) There are numerous ways in which frequencies outside a desired range can be filtered.": {}, "For example, an array of acoustical returners in accordance with the teachings of the present invention can be combined with sound absorbers to absorb frequencies the user does not want to have returned to the source.": {}, "One example of such absorbers consists of rendering the returners somewhat porous so that sound waves below the desired frequency range can travel through the porosity and into an absorbing area which may include fiberglass or other sound absorbing fabrics.": {}, "(4) One type of device that can provide the absorption of undesired frequencies consists of a hard panel that includes micro-slits therethrough.": {}, "Two examples of micro-slits are those disclosed in U.S.  Pat.": {}, "10,068,563 to D'Antonio et al.": {}, "which was issued on Sep., 2018.": {}, "Another example is disclosed in U.S.  Pat.": {}, "These two patents disclose differing types of micro-slits used as a sound absorber and either could be employed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.": [{"sub": "these two patents", "rel": "disclose", "obj":

accordance with", "obj": "the teachings of the present invention"}], "(5) Examples of environments of use for the present invention are an office setting or nursing station in which a large room is divided up into spaces or cubicles by partitions.": {}, "Acoustical returners in accordance with the teachings of the present invention can be mounted above each space or cubicle, for example, in ceiling mounted arrays or clouds above each space or cubicle.": {}, "A person within the space or cubicle speaking on the phone or with others will have his or her words returned back to them and passively amplified with extraneous sounds filtered out.": [{"sub": "a person within the space or cubicle speaking on the phone or with others", "rel": "will have his or her words returned back to",

"obj": "others"}, {"sub": "his or her words", "rel": "will amplified with", "obj": "extraneous sounds filtered out"}], "In this way, the speaker will hear his or her words loudly and this will encourage them to speak more softly so as not to disrupt workers in adjacent spaces or cubicles.": {}, "(6) In a further aspect, arrays of acoustical returners can be mounted in surrounding relation to a computer display so that if a worker within a cubicle is speaking in the direction of the display, his or her words are acoustically returned by the array in a passively amplified manner, thereby encouraging the speaker to speak more softly.": {}, "(7) As such, it is a first object of the present invention to provide an acoustical surface which consists of three mutually perpendicular planes to redirect incident sound from any direction, back into the incident direction.": {}, "(8) It is a further object of the present invention to utilize various polygons, for example, squares, rectangles, triangles, etc.": {}, "to form the three mutually perpendicular planes.": {}, "(9) It is a further object of the present invention to form multi-element arrays to form a plane surface directing incident sound back in the incident direction.": {}, "(11) It is a further object of the present invention to create zones in which no sound is allowed to reflect to other areas, thereby performing the action of an absorber, but instead of removing the sound, the invention captures the sound for constructive use.": {}, "(12) It is a further object of the present invention to take advantage of the psychoacoustic effect of reducing self-made sound by passively increasing its volume to the source, for example, a practicing instrumentalist or vocalist can hear oneself more clearly when the emitted sound is returned rather than scattered or absorbed.": {}, "(13) It is a further object of the present invention to design the surface to redirect a certain useful frequency bandwidth and transmit or absorb unwanted frequencies.": {}, "(14) It is a further object of the present invention to utilize transparent, translucent, and solid, microperforated or microslitted materials to achieve the desired functionality.": {}, "These and other aspects, objects and features of the present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments when read in conjunction with the appended drawing figures.": {}, "Those types are reflectors, absorbers, diffusers, and returners.": {}, "The ideal reflector reflects as much of the sound as is possible.": {}, "In an absorber, a percentage of the incident sound is absorbed by the absorber so that sound emanating from the absorber is reduced particularly in amplitude.": [{"sub": "a

opening thereof.": {}, "The normalized diffusion coefficient can be seen to be essentially 0 over this bandwidth, verifying that the invention does not diffuse sound but redirects it back in the direction of the source.": {}, "The array includes a multiplicity of tri-rectangular tetrahedra, each of which includes an apex and three mutually perpendicular sides, 17 and 19.": {}, "A person, 6 or 7 sitting at the respective workstations, 3 or 4 speaks and their speech is reflected by the array back to them so that they can hear themselves speak.": {}, "At the same time, the array assists in preventing their speech from emanating to the next adjacent cubicle and disturbing its occupant.": [{"sub": "the array", "rel": "assists in preventing their speech from", "obj": "emanating to the next adjacent cubicle"}, {"sub": "the array", "rel": "assists in preventing their speech from", "obj": "disturbing its occupant"}], "The array provides passive amplification which, to the speaker, makes it sound like they are speaking more loudly than they are speaking, which typically results in the speaker reducing the amplitude of their speech which also assists in precluding disturbing their adjacent neighbor.": {}, "There are three main choices of materials for the array.": {}, "A first possibility is a hard surface that reflects all incident sound back to the source.": {}, "This is the least desirable embodiment because it reflects all the sound waves including low frequencies below the bottom frequency of speech which can cause confusion to the speaker when his or her speech is reflected directly back to them.": [{"sub": "this", "rel": "is", "obj": "the least desirable embodiment"}, {"sub": "it", "rel": "reflects", "obj": "all the sound waves"}, {"sub": "the sound waves",

speaker"}, {"sub": "his or her speech", "rel": "is reflected directly back to", "obj": "them"}], "A second alternative is an opaque surface perhaps made of wood or other material but covered with microperforations which receive sound waves and, in effect, filter out the low frequency sounds below the bottom frequency of speech.": {}, "A third alternative is to make the array out of a transparent or translucent material that is covered with microslits which perform a similar sound filtering feature as is the case with the opaque surfaces covered with microperforations.": {}, "The advantage of making the array translucent or transparent is that it can be mounted beneath a light fixture so that light can be transmitted therethrough.": {}, "10,068,563 which covers microslits having wedge-shaped configuration formed in a substantially transparent surface.": {}, "The tetrahedron is designated by the reference numeral 30 and has an apex, walls, 35 and 37 with mutually perpendicular surfaces, and microperforations.": {}, "The microslits may have a wedge-shaped configuration as taught by U.S.  Pat.": {}, "10,068,563 or may have a uniform cross-section from front to rear as taught by U.S.  Pat.": {}, "However, Applicants note that neither of these issued patents teach the concepts of the present invention, namely, use of an array of corner reflectors to reflect incident sound back to its source and including filtration of low frequency sound waves.": {}, "Applicants note that another practical application for the array is in healthcare nursing stations in which overhead and vertical arrays can be used to confine all the noise in a local area and minimize intrusion of sound into patient rooms and other locations outside the nursing stations.": {}, "The overhead mounted array 10, otherwise described as \"clouds\" can be used in transportation and hospitality reservation desks to passively amplify speech in the locality of the parties involved to increase intelligibility without the need to shout and without interfering with conversations between other guests.": {}, "Additionally, arrays such as the array can also be used in stage shells for musical rehearsal and performance.": {}, "In such an environment, musicians will be better able to hear themselves and diffusers can also be employed so that such musicians can hear contributions from the entire ensemble.": [{"sub": "musicians", "rel": "will be better able to hear", "obj": "themselves"}, {"sub": "diffusers", "rel": "can be employed", "obj": ""}, {"sub": "such musicians", "rel":
