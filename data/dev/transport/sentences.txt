Because such elements and operations are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present disclosure, a discussion of such elements and operations may not be provided herein.
As the ECUs may include PUF components, the controller may query the ECU to identify which PUF component is compromised, in order to determine where in the sub-system the compromise is located.
In this manner, validation of the vehicle identity ensures the integrity of all of the components that make up the vehicle as well as information generated by any of the components that make up the vehicle.
Further, the term computer readable medium is meant to refer to any machine-readable medium (automated data medium) capable of storing data in a format readable by a mechanical device.
It is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.
Embodiments of the invention may also be implemented in one or a combination of hardware, firmware, and software.
They may be implemented as instructions stored on a machine-readable medium, which may be read and executed by a computing platform to perform the operations described herein.
While specific exemplary embodiments have been discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only.
Further, repeated use of the phrase "in one embodiment," or "in an exemplary embodiment," do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, although they may.
This method may be integrated in a variety of systems including connected cars, car sharing, rental car services, maintenance and factory services.
A further aspect provides a meaningful capture of the congestion level information enabling appropriate congestion mitigation measures, for example according to the severeness of the congestion.
A congestion may be detected based on said congestion value when said minimum bandwidth demand exceeds the measured traffic per time over a given time span.
The term "part" in connection with the term "network" is to be understood in a broad sense, meaning that part of the network can be any real or imaginary fraction, portion or component of the network.
Most eNBs use variants of proportional-fair scheduling, where cell capacity fluctuates depending on time-variant radio conditions and scheduling assignments.
While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such illustration and description are to be considered illustrative or exemplary and not restrictive.
At least one embodiment has the advantage of capturing of congestion levels in such a way that congestion mitigation measures can be reliably performed.
Said congestion value may be adapted via a transformation function, wherein said transformation function amends at least one of the following: a number of congestion levels, a steepness of a congestion level curve, a shape of a congestion level curve.
Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.
This enhances the flexibility of the congestion value, since different operators can use different transformation functions or profiles such that the congestion level may be based per cell and per link with different feedback profiles depending on the need of an operator.
This may lead to inaccuracy due to the varying nature of instantaneous traffic patterns and dependence on medium- to long-term congestion situations for reporting.
Even a small open area can present a danger when loose items are being transported in high-traffic areas.
Particularly, the application relates to a tarpaulin bracket system for mounting to a vehicle to provide a structure for attachment of a tarp.
Further, the hazards of loose items flying out of the open-top of cargo trailers has led many governing bodies to enact strict laws against such open transport.
The plurality of connectors is detachably connected to one of either the first and second cables and to each end of every bow.
The matter set forth in the foregoing description and accompanying drawings is offered by way of illustration only and not as a limitation.
The actual scope of the protection sought is intended to be defined in the following claims when viewed in their proper perspective based on the prior art.
Preferably, most of these components are made of strong materials to withstand the conditions of being atop an open cargo area of a vehicle during transportation of goods.
Later, a series of bows was brought into use to keep the tarpaulin from lying in direct contact with goods in the truck trailer and to prevent water accumulation.
Additionally, the motorized system doesn't always extend far enough to cover the entire open-top cargo hold.
A first set of left and right pulleys are attached at the front with a second set of left and right pulleys attached at the rear of the cargo hold.
The present invention relates to a rubber composite comprising rubber, oil and a combination of powdered additives, as well as a process for manufacturing same.
The incorporation of granulated recycled tire rubber into bitumen aimed to improve the mechanical behavior of bituminous mixtures.
In this connection, the properties of the asphalt bitumen-based binders in high and low temperature conditions are of a decisive importance.
The rubber has an internal structure, being characterized by open cellular structure containing pores that are connected to one another and form an interconnected network; and an external surface, being the outmost surface of the rubber particles.
The term oil-dry thus stands to mean that the external surface, namely the out-most layer of the rubber composite, is substantially, or completely, free of oil.
When the particles are of non-spheroid shape, the term refers to the average equivalent diameter of the particle, namely the diameter of an equivalent spherical particle based on the longest dimension of the particle.
In some embodiments, the process further comprises a pre-step of grinding the rubber prior to employing the process of this invention to reduce the particles to a desired size.
Accordingly, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible sub-ranges as well as individual numerical values within that range.
It is clearly the lowest value as compared with tradition Asphalt Rubber gap graded mixtures (with and without RAR) or even compared with traditional SMA mixtures with highly modified bitumen and fibres.
It should be noted that the range is given as such merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention.
The disclosure is directed to a communication path managing method and a communication path managing system.
At least one of the communication paths for the vehicle is selected according to the evaluation items based on the item importance information.
The selecting unit is for selecting at least one of the communication paths for the vehicle according to the evaluation items based on the item importance information.
Besides, the performance of some of the communication path PH may be limited to a particular geographical range.
The shaded area located at the lower side of the dotted line L2 belongs the good category of the available bandwidth.
Both of the routing path latency and the connection keeping ability are taken into consideration to find out the best communication path PH.
All of the evaluation items EV of each of the communication paths PH in the third group G3 is worse than the standard thresholds E0.
In the good category of the available bandwidth, the value of the routing path latency is equal to or lower than 500 kbps.
It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the disclosure being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.
In the good category of the routing path latency, the value of the routing path latency is equal to or lower than 50 ms.
In many applications, it is desirable to have a threaded nut fastened on a threaded bolt with a permanent hold that will not loosen when exposed to high vibration environments.
The self-locking nut may be made of any standard nut materials including brass, steel, stainless steel, titanium, plastic, nylon and other materials depending on usage specifications and demands.
In this example the thickness of the lip material must fully collapse/seat at 8000 lbs to 9000 lbs of pressure.
As more torque is applied to overcome the resistance of the deforming crush-locking lips which is unable to rotate, the gap between the two nut parts begin to close as they are compressed together.
The material and design of the crush-locking lips may change, including shape, height, size, number and shape of relief cuts may vary depending on intended specific application.
The two parts may be made of solid metal material and tapped with threads, or may initially have no center hole and no threads and are tapped after joining together.
When threaded on a bolt to bring the front face of the joined parts against an object, the collapsing volume of the jam nut portion moves against the threads of the nut body portion.
It also has a higher strength-to-weight ratio than conventional locking nuts, although it resembles a conventional nut when in the locked position.
It is light-weight, weighing the same as a conventional nut, and lighter than current two-piece lock-nuts.
It is intended that all such modifications and variations be considered as within the spirit and scope of this invention, as defined in the following claims.
An IPS can locate mobile devices inside a building using radio waves, magnetic fields, acoustic signals, and/or other sensory information collected by mobile devices.
According to some embodiments of the present invention, there are provided methods and systems of removing IPS noise.
The predetermined maximal time difference may also be configurable, for example between sample seconds and sample minutes, or any other range.
Some embodiments of the invention are herein described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings.
First, in an indoor venue, the signals are attenuated and scattered by static obstacles such as walls and "dynamic obstacles" such as people.
When the difference between the movement direction and the new movement direction is small, it is concluded that the movement direction of mobile device is not changed.
When the movement velocity is higher than a predetermined maximal velocity, the current position sample is marked as noise.
Such a classification error may cause the algorithm to also classify subsequent samples as noisy ones, since a valid sample was eliminated from the data.
Many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the described embodiments.
It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment.
The present disclosure describes a method for providing information to a mobile device based on an event at a geographical location.
In response to receiving alert messages from the event alert system, service provider sites forward the alert messages to its mobile devices, which in turn notify their mobile users.
The alert is then forwarded from the at least one service provider site to at least one mobile device associated with the at least one service provider site.
In still yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a location of at least one service provider site is identified from a geographical information system.
Once the captured event information is received, the event alert system may store and process the information in a repository or database.
To accomplish this step, the information from the captured image may be compared to information stored within the repository or database.
Furthermore, additional information about the event may include instructions from government agencies indicating precautions to take against the event.
Alert messages may also be sent first to the service provider sites or other systems, which then forward the messages to associated mobile devices.
In this way, alert messages may be sent to specific mobile devices at or near the geographical location of the event.
In addition, one or more types of messages may be sent simultaneously to a mobile device based on the type of events.
The ANG meets the basic requirements for nerve grafts in peripheral nerve tissue engineering, and becomes aft tissue-derived ECM modified tissue engineered nerve grafts.
The nerve grafts are beneficial to cell adhesion, and likely to prompt axonal regeneration, thus overcoming the drawbacks of existing technologies.
Therefore, the following helps to promote nerve regeneration and function restoration, and will be developed into a feasible clinical therapy.
ECM provides mechanical support and physical strength for the integrity of tissues, organs, and the whole organism.
Unless defined otherwise, all terms used in embodiments of the present invention have the same meaning as commonly used by the researchers in the field of tissue engineering.
Skins in the back are taken out and placed in a pre-cooled dissection solution to remove subcutaneous tissue (fat, hypodermic fascia layer, and blood vessels).
At one or two weeks post surgery, animals are transcardially perfused, and the regenerated nerve segments are then harvested and cut into sections.
The silk fibroin filaments included in the conduit lumen are prepared by electrostatic spinning, having a large specific surface area to serve as a required space for the growth of nerve cells.
In the following examples, various processes and methods which are not described in details are conventional methods known in the field of tissue engineering.
Evidence shows that LN, FN and Col can provide suitable "adhesiveness" for nerve growth, make axons grow along a matrix bridge, and guide the directional growth of nerve fibers.
Recently it has become important to utilize electric vehicles in many forms as transportation under the belief that the use of electric vehicles is an environmentally conscious decision.
As an example, motorcycles in the past have been utilized as police motorcycles, enabling singular officers to manipulate traffic and transport singular officers between points quickly and efficiently.
The front portion can also extend from a rocker portion of the frame upward to engage the forks.
Processes for modifying electric motorcycles are also provided, and these processes can include providing crash bars to the electric motorcycles.
An example of a completed motorcycle is shown in the 2014 Zero DS Police motorcycle brochure filed herewith, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
However, electric motorcycles are designed with lighter frames and components, making the use of traditional components on electric motorcycles in some circumstances unfeasible.
The process can also include coupling a lower portion of the crash bars to the rocker portion, and to the support members.
As can be seen, electric motorcycle can be supported by wheels and provide a seat for a rider above the frame that includes rocker portion.
In particular embodiments, the present disclosure provides police motorcycles as well that include crash bars.
Fit members can be hollowed members that extend normally from plate members and are configured to engage a portion of crash bars to be coupled therewith.
However, different original equipment manufacturers provide similar after-sales service, such as maintenance check service and repair service.
Hence, an objective of the present invention is to design a system from the concept of the vehicle original equipment manufacturer.
The information is used to implement after-sales service activities to provide innovative service and meet the owner's need.
The main controller is adapted to be equipped on a vehicle and to transmit vehicle information of the vehicle designated by an original equipment manufacturer.
The cloud platform can communicate with an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) electronic device and a vehicle owner's electronic device, such as a personal computer, a laptop, a smart phone, a tablet, and so on.
Therefore, the present invention can accomplish the purposes of timely and accurate after-sales service and meeting the vehicle's need by actively providing the vehicle information.
In conclusion, the innovative service of the present invention can advance people's living standard, integrate various supply chains, and accomplish the purposes of environment protection and energy conservation.
The original equipment manufacturer can determine what kind of after-sales service should be offered based on the received vehicle information.
As a result, the original equipment manufacturer fails to effectively monitor the car condition.
Significantly, the vehicle information sent to the cloud platform is set by an original equipment manufacturer that manufactures the vehicle.
Solar power systems consist of multiple components, including the photovoltaic modules, mechanical and electrical connections and mountings and means of regulating or modifying the electrical output.
The frame can support a plurality of rechargeable batteries, a battery management system, an inverter and a power outlet.
When the trailer is moving, the solar panels can be rotated so that they are vertically aligned with the back surfaces of the solar panels facing outward.
Once at the required location, the portable solar power system can be positioned to optimize the amount of sunlight exposure provided to the solar panels.
When the solar panels stop producing power, the stored power in the batteries can be transmitted to the inverter and converted into AC power that is transmitted to the outlet.
The solar panels can then be rotated to be close to perpendicular to the arc of the sun across the sky.
The product design may give the portable solar power system the ability to maximize exposure to the sun regardless of latitude or seasonal variations.
While an exemplary locking mechanism has been illustrated, in other embodiments, any other suitable rotational locking mechanism can be used.
In larger portable solar power system such as buildings and remote water pumps, AC electrical power may usually be required.
Although the order filling apparatus and method have been described include various components, it is well understood that these components and the described configuration can be modified and rearranged in various other configurations.
In an embodiment, the present invention provides a method for merging imprecisely localized traffic reports with precisely localized traffic data.
Based on these functions and certain parameters, optimum, precise positions are found for traffic reports having imprecise position indications by solving an extremum problem.
In this case, weighting factors gx are definable by a-priori knowledge of the quality of a source.
The invention is defined solely with regard to the claims appended hereto, and equivalents of the recitations therein.
The real-time generation of traffic information for information or navigation services is usually based on multiple data sources for the purpose of achieving the best possible quality.
Embodiments of the invention provide optimum achievement of the data merging object in the case of incomplete information.
Wherever the imprecisely localized report competes with lack of knowledge from the traffic situation estimate, the relevant portion of the report is taken as the end product.
Substitutions of elements from one embodiment to another are also fully intended and contemplated.
The method includes obtaining a plurality of possible positions (x) of the localized traffic reports having imprecise position indications.
Between the two junctions lie kilometers of highway and sensors report additional junctions--the position of the traffic disturbance is therefore very imprecisely determined.
Power plants are subject to stringent environmental monitoring and even an individual's automobile now carries extensive pollution control and abatement systems.
Often such laws simply prohibit diesel idling for more than a specified period of time, such as five minutes, unless one of a few certain exceptions occur.
A database is provided that has idling regulation information stored therein based, at least, upon geographic location.
This alert may take the form of an indication (audible, visual, or both) provided via an onboard display, such as on the dashboard of the vehicle or a user interface within the cab of vehicle alerting the driver of the potential violation.
In any event, the potential violation is identified and the driver of the vehicle, or other responsible party, is messaged or otherwise communicated with to address the threat.
For example, one operator may be willing to risk minor fines with respect to a violation where another operator would simply want his or her vehicle shut down.
For example, an operator at the control center can analyze information received from the vehicles (either real-time or historical) and provide reports based on the analysis.
Such actions can involve the driver ignoring the alarm, the driver acknowledging the alarm, the driver choosing to move the vehicle, or the driver choosing to shut the vehicle down.
Instead, only information regarding potential and/or actual idling regulation violations can be communicated between the vehicle and communication center.
Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
Arrangements are proposed through which a driver of a vehicle in such a platoon may allow the throttle and the brakes of the vehicle to be handled automatically.
According to the latter concept; each vehicle will depending on its state and the state of the neighboring vehicle utilize a control strategy to follow its movements and maintain the platoon.
The following vehicle includes a correcting unit for correcting the received control variable data depending upon the type of the front running vehicle and the type of the following vehicle.
Embodiments herein aim to provide an apparatus for lateral control of a host vehicle during travel in a vehicle platoon.
Further embodiments herein aim to provide a method for lateral control of a host vehicle during travel in a vehicle platoon.
The controller may include a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable digital signal processor (DSP) or other programmable device.
It is to note that in linear system theory any signal can be described as a combination of sinus signals, hence the generality of the result.
For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are equivalent.
The front running vehicle not only controls its own movements on the basis of the control variable data but also transmits them to a following vehicle.
The distance would typically be dependent of velocity, since higher velocities require larger safety-distances.
Each such layer is designed to accomplish a certain objective and each such layer requires a certain format of data.
These extra bytes are overhead to the data being transferred across the air interface and in many situations is excessive, particularly for low data rate transfers.
Advantage is taken of the fact that the extra overhead from, for example, the Ethernet protocol is addressing information pertaining to the destination of the packet.
In one embodiment, the MAC address of the destination is used for the air interface and the Ethernet address is recreated and added on the far side of the air interface.
In such a system, the access router tells the base station the Ethernet address information of the destination during the authentication process.
The CPE, having the same information in its look-up table as did the base station, then adds the Ethernet address for delivery to the PC.
The packets will then be delivered to the base station, using the base station's address and the base station will forward the packet the CPE.
The base station then adds the proper Ethernet header because the base station saved the response from the DHCP server.
From the DHCP snooping point of view, the system actually snoops the DHCP packet at both the CPE and base station so that the bridge knows how to route the IP packets.
Moreover, the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, means, methods and steps described in the specification.
A global optimization problem is usually solved with a numerical method, such as simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithm and so on.
The business information may include, but not limited to, transaction history with a specific customer, potential business from a specific customer, satisfaction of a specific customer and so on.
The dependency is such that the current solution changes almost randomly when T is large, but increasingly become stable as T goes to zero.
In some circumstances, the problem may include more constraints other than those set forth above to take additional factors into consideration.
For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations.
In one implementation, the computer program is equipped with a computation engine configured to operate the simulated annealing algorithm.
The constraints in a quantitative feasible solution are consolidated to a new numerical resultant and the new numerical resultant is mapped to a qualitative solution.
In this example, the quantitative feasible solution is mapped to a "moderately economical" qualitative solution.
In a vehicle routing problem within time windows, for example, the capacity of each vehicle is an independent constraint as it is not associated with other constraints.
The business consideration associated with the second predetermined rule may include, but is not limited to, transaction history with a specific customer, potential business from a specific customer, satisfaction of a specific customer, and so on.
This results in extreme spikes in the network load, especially when data is required to be transferred to a large number of clients simultaneously, causing delays in data transmission.
These will generally include, for example, the file type and size, time stamps for activation and deactivation of the content, encryption and compression details, etc.
The modified transport request identifies the relevant first terminal as the server address from which its subset of the target terminals should retrieve the data.
At each stage, it is preferred that the "best" terminals from the list of remaining targets are selected to act as relay servers for the remainder.
Preferably, there is also an upstream communication path from each terminal, terminals direct to the main server.
The opening and operation of sockets is handled dynamically using a C++ class-application which generates a new socket when it needs a new instance of this class.
Once the route to a particular target has been established, the packets of the data file are passed along the defined route via the selected relay servers on the basis of the target terminal address in the handle/header of each packet.
This mechanism also provides for data verification: the size of each data type is predetermined and the amount of received data must correspond to the size of the data type.
In some circumstances, data transfers to a single target terminal using the invention might not be significantly faster than conventional download methods.
The network database need not be on the same server/computer as the distribution management system (that generates the transport requests), but must be accessible to it.
Automatically guided vehicles (AGVs) typically follow known paths (such as defined by a guidance wire embedded in the floor) in an operating environment and are controlled by an AGV server so that they do not collide with each other.
This system is thus a means of enhancing operations in mixed manned and unmanned vehicle environments.
When a collision between a manned and an un-manned vehicle is predicted the system will send a command message to the AGV server stop or reduce the speed of the unmanned vehicle.
If network communications are interrupted for a predetermined period of time alarm messages are transmitted to all manned vehicles alerting the operators.
The apparatus calculates the current predicted trajectory and safety zone of each manned vehicle to determine any areas of intersection with other manned or unmanned vehicles.
Such modifications are to be construed as lying within the contemplation of the present invention, as defined by the appended claims.
A message is transmitted to the Manned Vehicle Server and a warning sent to one or more manned vehicles to alert the one or more operators of a predicted potential collision, so that the one or more operators can take appropriate action to avoid the predicted collision.
There is a definable collision type that can override whether or not a collision is actually reported if predicted.
Automatically guided vehicles (AGVs) move along predetermined paths and are controlled and tracked by an AGV Server.
Manned vehicles equipped with the position and rotational orientation (PRO) system are referred to as "PRO equipped vehicles" or simply PROVs.
A need therefore exists for apparatus and methods for uplink power control during link imbalance that considers the reverse link HS-DPCH.
An OR of DOWNs determines whether to increase or decrease the pilot signal strength.
This link imbalance condition can occur when Node-B2 is sending a DOWN request and Node-B1 is sending an UP request.
Reducing the traffic-to-pilot ratio reduces the average return link interferences by reducing the traffic channel strength in relation to the pilot signal strength.
That is, the Node-B serving the high speed data over the HS-DSCH is different from the Node-B to which the UE has the best uplink for the DPCCH.
If a NAK is received by the sending Node-B1, the sending Node-B1 can re-transmit the previously sent packet data.
The decreased strength of the ACK/NAK signal can result in ACKs being received as NAKs that lead to increased transmissions on HS-DSCH; and NAKs or NULLs being received as ACKs that lead to missed packets on HS-DSCH.
Node-B can be a device a cellular base station having beam-forming antennas that serves various sectors of a cell.
Further, because the UE sends channel quality indication (CQI) over HS-DPCCH, Node-B1 may receive false indications.
The UE can be a device, such as, a cellular phone or other fixed or mobile wireless devices.
In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a method and apparatus provides presence information regarding a wireless device.
It allows users to choose exactly which location and presence information to make available to specific vendors or other users.
Whether a carrier opts for in-house or hosted services, the XLP provides a highly available and scalable distributed network architecture.
Importantly, in accordance with the present invention, information relating to presence is spawned or triggered by a location request.
If a global positioning satellite system is utilized, the location request may be forwarded to a suitable GPS application in the wireless network that receives GPS location information regarding a relevant wireless device.
Message reduction in general is desirable, both to allow increased capacity in a wireless network, as well as to improve reliability of the system by reducing the number of messages.
The three module centers in the exemplary XLP used in the disclosed embodiments are a Location Center, a Presence Center, and a Privacy Center.
Location information regarding subscribers is increasingly becoming available in a wireless network.
This avoids the need for the presence client to separately request presence information regarding that particular wireless device.
In this use case, location information regarding a particular subscriber is being requested, and within the same message, presence information such as subscriber state may also be requested.
Pre-wetting the salt helps it work more effectively as a deicing agent for two reasons: Firsts wet salt clings to the road instead of bouncing off or being swept off by traffic.
The most inexpensive is the use of sodium chloride and water or salt brine which is a salt and water solution.
The addition of a liquid chemical to salt enhances its ability to provide safe levels of service by increasing the speed at which salt creates brine to melt snow or ice.
Others apply a given amount to each loader bucket prior to loading in the spreader.
Another method of wetting the salt is to spray the salt with sodium chloride or salt brine as it is leaving the spreader.
In this way, the material is pre-wetted in a controlled environment eliminating over spray and drifting into the atmosphere allowing an even distribution of liquid to the material.
These nozzles spray the material as it is rotated and moved through the passage by the auger to present uniformly pre-wetted material to the spinner.
If salt brine is intended to be used the salt brine mixture is the typical mixture used in the application of salt brine as known by those of ordinary skill in the art.
As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the auger drive rotates the auger to rotate and drive material from the hopper, through the passage to the chute.
One feature of the controller is the ability to monitor the auger feed rate and automatically adjust the amount of liquid supplied to the auger.
The present invention relates to process control systems of the type used to monitor and/or control operation of industrial processes.
The sensed process variable can be used to control the process or can provide information about process operation to an operator.
A process control loop monitor includes a loop interface circuit configured to couple to a process control loop and receive data from the process control loop.
Such issues can be particularly troublesome when the industrial process is located in a remote area, or when the service personnel are inexperienced in diagnosing network related problems.
One typical technique for transmitting information in an industrial process control and monitoring system involves controlling the amount of current flowing through a process control loop.
Fieldbus is a communications protocol developed by the Fieldbus Foundation and is directed to defining a communications layer or protocol for transmitting information on a process control loop.
For example, the received data can be inspected to determine if it is of the type desired for logging, such as from a particular process device or a particular data type.
In some configurations, input/output circuitry also includes a power output which provides power to the circuitry within monitor which is generated from a current I carried on loop.
Once the desired amount of data has been logged into memory, or after some other period, the data is collected by a service personnel for evaluation.
In one specific example, the loop monitor does not contain any process interface element such as a sensor or control element.
Furthermore, the stops are made at pre-determined times, within the standard fluctuations of traffic and weather conditions.
It is thus necessary to review the stops and routes on a periodic basis to determine if changes are required to provide optimal service to passengers.
The present invention relates to the field of fixed route assignments in a transit network.
Over time, it can become apparent that certain flexible stops are being requested at a high rate and possibly at a higher rate than existing stops.
This data is then input into a decision-making algorithm which uses user-defined parameters to determine if stops should be added or deleted or if changes should be made to the route.
By using this additional data in the algorithm, the modifications to the route may be restricted to certain time periods based on the pattern of requests.
Furthermore, it is contemplated that the granting of permission for passenger requests for deviations may be implemented in any desired fashion on the transit network.
The foregoing description has been presented for the purpose of illustration and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.
The first step is to permit the vehicle to stop at locations along the route which are not currently designated stops in response to passenger requests to embark/disembark the vehicle.
Reviewing developments along the route, such as a new shopping or residential complex, can provide some insight regarding general locations for new stops.
This is followed by the inclination of the outer running surface section, the outer bevelling of the running profile and the outer wheel rim or tire front face.
As a result of contact with the wheel flange, jerking steering movements and hence high quasi-static transverse forces are experienced, which may easily exceed the limit values for route loading.
Because of the relatively large radius of entry into the transitional area from the running surface to the wheel flange, the wheel profile of the wheels is characterized by a low equivalent conicity.
For the wheel profile of the wheels according to the invention the design of the areas of the wheel profile which are described by the groove of the running profile and the running surface is a particularly decisive factor.
This in turn results in a positive steering moment of the wheel set, and hence to better radial setting of the wheel set.
Radius R303 about center M7 lies within a tolerance range of between 300 and 305 mm, and commences from 1 to 2 mm from the center of the measuring circle, in which the centers then vary accordingly.
In the case of retreading it is not necessary to undercut as much volume as for conventional wheel profiles.
The disadvantage of this profile is that it develops a slight difference in radius between the right and left wheel due to the minimal displacement in the wheel channel, particularly on rails with a built-in gradient of 1:20.
The radius of 216 mm at entry into the slope of the wheel flange commences in the center of the measuring circle plane.
The running profile of the wheel exhibits an inner wheel rim or tire front face to which is connected the wheel flange.
For example, similar to previously obtained traffic information data may be received from an exclusive information communication system.
Various exemplary implementations of the principles described herein provide a storage medium sorting a set of program instructions executable on a data processing device and usable to transmit traffic information.
The communication unit may receive road traffic information from the exclusive information communication system and may output the data to the controller.
Based upon control by the controller, the output unit may display information required for the vehicle.
For example, a route from the starting point to the destination is searched as a tentative route based on the accumulated data in the memory.
For example, current link travel times for all links within the target area may be obtained from VICS and/or the probe car via the communication unit as current data.
For example, the systems and methods described herein are applicable to vehicles other than a private car, and may be for example, a van, a bus, and/or a train.
Each link may be separated and defined by, for example, an intersection, an intersection having more than three roads, a curve, and/or a point at which the road type changes.
Next in step 800, a guidance route is searched in consideration of, for example link travel times accumulated in the database of the memory.
Accordingly, various exemplary implementations of the principles described herein provide a traffic information transmitting apparatus including a memory that stores accumulated traffic information including past traffic information and a controller.
The present invention relates to elevator installations with a plurality of individually movable elevator cars and a method of operating such elevator cars.
It is a disadvantage of the known elevators with several elevator hoistways that changing hoistways mechanically is very complex and in many cases proceeds only slowly.
Conventional elevator installations are known which, for the purpose of increasing the handling capacity, are equipped with a so-called double-deck car.
In many cases, the distance between the individual floors is not equal, which requires complex measures on the double-deck car.
In view of the known arrangements it is a purpose of the present invention to make available an elevator installation and a corresponding method which reduce or completely avoid the disadvantages of the state of the art.
An elevator installation with several individually driven elevator cars working in double-deck mode could also be operated in two-way mode.
Through the use of a temporary multi-deck arrangement, the handling capacity is substantially improved without the flexibility of the elevator installation being impaired.
The present invention can be applied to elevator installations with spatially separated or unseparated elevator hoistways.
It is also conceivable that loading/unloading the elevator cars of a temporary multi-deck arrangement takes place via intermediate floors, ramps, or suchlike.
Also advantageous is an elevator installation which has at least one transfer zone for horizontal movement of the elevator cars.
In a normal elevator system, speed, acceleration, and jerk rate of each elevator are set in advance and not changed.
Further, in many recent elevator systems, as soon as a passenger presses a call button in an elevator hall, a hall lantern is lit to inform the passenger of a responding unit.
In particular, when the car travels a long distance, the traveling time can be substantially reduced by increasing the speed.
The group supervisory control apparatus includes communication means, load detecting means, variable-speed setting means, learning means, estimation processing means, assignment means, and traveling control means.
When it is determined that the in-cage load is not within the allowable range for high-speed/high-acceleration operation, the speed, the acceleration, and the jerk rate are set to normal values.
In this case, the traveling distance is therefore regarded as a long distance when it is equal to or longer than the acceleration/deceleration distance calculated from the equation .
In the foregoing description, one of the speed, the acceleration, and the jerk rate is selectively increased in accordance with the in-cage load.
Still further, an estimated result obtained from the estimation processing means in the group supervisory control apparatus may be utilized when performing a variable-speed operation in each control device.
The learning means statistically learns the traffic within a building and stores a learnt result.
Included in the evaluated value calculations are, for example, those for the evaluation of waiting time, fully occupied condition probability.
It is to be noted that the threshold voltage drifts in a very large range, which distribution can be simulated like a Gaussian curve.
The gate of the organic transistor is connected to the ground voltage, and the first source/drain of the organic transistor is connected to the power source voltage Vdd.
The printed NAND gate includes a plurality of sets of signal input circuits, a load circuit and a level shifter circuit.
The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.
Further, the voltage at the node at which the signal input circuit and the load circuit connected to each other can be shifted to a predetermined level by the level shifter circuit.
Practically, all organic transistors employed in the embodiment of the present invention are exemplified with PMOS transistors.
However, as the standard deviation increases, or more printed inverters are serially cascaded, the difference among the yields will be significant.
Accordingly, the level shifter circuit includes a gain organic transistor and a level shifter organic transistor that are connected in parallel.
As such, even though a threshold voltage of one of the organic transistor drifts, the organic transistor is still cut-off, so as to maintain routine operation of the circuit.
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.
The present invention relates generally to the field of self-organizing ad hoc network systems.
In view of the foregoing, there is a need for an airborne system that provides a means of engaging a number of aggressive combatants simultaneously.
The oracle has a means for being located behind said devices and relays the devices shared data and outcome to a control base.
An inter-vehicle data link allows the vehicles to cooperate with one another to achieve a common goal, which is to seek and pursue targets in a way that will increase the probability of kill.
This message traffic is used to initially assign canisters to targets so as to maximize an objective, such as, for example, the global probability of intercepting all targets.
A low-cost infrared (IR) or visible wavelength camera may be used for detecting the angular position of targets within the vicinity of, and relative to, the canister.
It is noteworthy that since fuzing information is transmitted just prior to detonation, the GPS information can also be used for locating any unexploded ordinance.
The potential function provides the local guidance and control for formation flying, while divert thrusters provide the necessary maneuver capability.
The baseband transceiver applies a time-division duplex scheme that allows the canisters to alternately transmit and receive data packets in a synchronous manner.
Since the canister is very small and lightweight, it might not possess enough impulse to change its direction of motion to coincide with that of the target.
Other networks take advantage of advanced features of network devices, such as priority, custom, and weighted fair queuing.
M requires enforcement of high-level policy information throughout a computer data network.
The information can include, for example, source and destination addresses, application identification information, and protocol type.
The network devices typically support configuration information called remotely modifiable filter lists that allow basic actions to be performed on data packets whose protocol fields match the filter.
Low-level information is updated quickly since mapping high-level information into low-level configuration information is a dynamic, on-going process.
Only a few mapping servers that interact with the network's infrastructure are required to provide the desired result.
Also, a hierarchy of the mapping servers can be created such that scalable policy distribution can be achieved.
An efficient and distributed architecture for controlling networks through policy information can be achieved.
The endstations also interact with other network infrastructure devices that are responsible for handling, forwarding, and routing communications data.
Therefore, a highly dynamic mapping from high-level policy to low-level configuration information can be achieved.
Coordination of meetings between two or more parties has always required, at a minimum, that each party communicate his or her available times to the other.
Some services provide for dynamic arrangement of meeting locations using voice communications over a telephone or radio.
Missed service calls leading to repeat attempts at delivery are common and expensive for both parties.
Systems which implement dynamic adjustments of meeting locations and/or schedules also require considerable manual effort.
The system may designate the times and/or locations of meetings, which it coordinates through one or more of a variety of communications means.
For example, unexpected road network traffic congestion resulting in delays may cause the system to rearrange meetings scheduled later in the day.
The proposed meeting schedules include meeting data, time, location and parties attending based on the meeting data stored in the database.
Predicted service times and service time probability distributions may be used to estimate the time at which service can be provided.
Characteristics of the meeting from the database may be recorded along with associated meeting participant communications for statistical analysis and later retrieval.
The schedules are then relayed to the participants directly, or to the dispatchers who communicate the schedule information to the participants.
In the Internet, data is transferred over a global network of heterogeneous computers by means of a plurality of routing devices in accordance with a standard protocol known as Internet Protocol (IP).
Routers are devices for accepting incoming packets; temporarily storing each packet; and then forwarding the packets to another part of the network.
For high capacity routers with large numbers of virtual circuits, large numbers of timers are required.
A fragment is defined as a part of a packet of data which is transmitted separately due to the constraints of a network.
Therefore, packet handling has to be as simple as possible to allow the higher levels of hardware integration required and reduce development risk.
It will be appreciated that, although twenty buffer elements are shown, any suitable number can be employed in accordance with a particular application.
When the first cell for a given packet arrives, a buffer element is taken from the head of the free list, for example, buffer element, and the packet data from the first cell is copied into that buffer element.
It will be readily appreciated that this technique could also be used for protection against certain so-called "denial of service" attacks upon computer networks.
The target (using a conventional reassembly scheme as described above) will reserve resources for each reassembly, resulting in buffer exhaustion.
Accordingly, a large packet may be broken into a number of small packets to be reassembled at their ultimate destination.
Nowadays, many people consume fast food,--such as hamburgers, pizza, sandwiches, hot dogs, gourmet coffee and the like.
The typical "hot dog stand" is exposed to environmental disruptions such as noise and pollution.
The operational advantage of this stand is that it is easily moved from place to place, and merely requires a simple local electrical connection.
Accordingly, the administrative requirements for food service licensing have become more strict, thus greater efforts are needed to uphold this requirement to obtain and maintain the needed licensing.
The term "non self-propelled" is used to denote a mobile unit that lacks its own motored driving mechanism.
Thus, in order to meet the efficient transport stipulations, the food service unit, according to an embodiment of the invention, is limited in size and weight.
According to the preferred embodiment, the invention is a non-self-propelled mobile food service point unit efficiently transportable to a desired location of service.
The unit lacks its own motorized driving mechanism and, thus, an external mechanism such as a boom-truck or a tow platform is required for the relocation of the unit.
A main entrance door serves for walking in and out the unit and is located at the lower half of the unit.
The invention is of course not bound by this construction, and accordingly other means, in addition or in lieu of the specified space, may be used.
World natural gas consumption is rising faster than that of any other fossil fuel.
With the demand for electricity constantly increasing, the demand for natural gas can be expected to increase even further.
Liquefaction makes it practical to ship natural gas in large volumes, using specially designed ships that maintain the cargo's ultra-low temperature.
Built of concrete and steel, the inner tanks typically are made of 9% nickel steel and the secondary containers are typically made of pre-stressed concrete with a steel liner.
However, public concern about safety has caused the gas industry to look for remote sites for such facilities.
Both types of tanks, whether prismatic or spherical, and whether membrane insulated or not, have been proposed for use in offshore LNG regasification systems.
The flow of gas from the barge to the onshore pipeline system (not shown) may be accomplished through a riser connected to the sea bottom where an underwater pipeline receiving end exists.
One aspect of the invention is an offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification system, which includes a mobile floating platform having a regasification unit disposed on it.
The invention thus avoids the need to provide storage for LNG on the floating platform which houses the regasification unit, as is typical for prior art offshore regasification systems.
In one example of a method according to this aspect of the invention, the modified VLCC may sail under its own power to the other geographic locations as required by market conditions.
Cities are crowded, choked with traffic, and even air transportation systems are increasingly operating at full capacity.
Among the difficulties in developing water transportation is the inherent lack of speed with conventional shipping, and the rough ride associated with hydroplaning ships.
The present invention teaches and discloses an apparatus for traveling at high speeds over water with a comfortable ride, dynamic stability, and efficient mechanical traction of props in water.
Another object of the invention is to provide a hydrodynamic lifting means so as to lift the apparatus to a dynamic waterline while the apparatus is operating under flight conditions.
Means for floatation displaces the platform element upward to reestablish a static waterline level.
Retracting each one of the inflatable members reduces aerodynamic resistance to the forward travel of the apparatus.
Air injector valves actuate in combination with air jet valves to maintain an air cushion under the apparatus.
Air distributed over the cambered surface of forward wing element reinforces a volumetric flow of air over the wing and generates a secondary lifting effect.
Another object of the invention is to provide a means for maneuvering operation so as to turn and maneuver the apparatus in `close` operating conditions, such as when docking.
As the large surface area of platform element is pulled through the air, a large coefficient of drag builds up between the flat underside of platform element and the water.
More specifically, but without limitation thereto, the present invention relates to a device for monitoring eye activity to detect the onset of low alertness levels.
Monitoring human operators for signs of fatigue is important in transportation, security, and process control environments where lapses in attention may be disastrous.
Other recent studies have reported on eye activity relative to performance level in simulated transportation environments.
A need therefore exists for a non-obtrusive eye activity monitor that does not require a mechanical or electrical connection to the subject and that can estimate drowsiness in real time.
No embodiment of the present invention described herein shall preclude other embodiments or advantages that may exist or become obvious to those skilled in the art.
An eye tracking module accepts an optical input from which module measures eye position and pupil diameter.
The sample history is retained for calculating a moving average of the pupil diameter, and preferably contains at least the previous 90 seconds of eye position and pupil diameter data.
Eyelid droop this severe may nearly cover the entire pupil during conditions of extreme drowsiness without excessive blinking or complete closure of the eye.
Blink duration and frequency are calculated preferably over a 60 second period and updated at least every 10 seconds.
Alertness estimation module integrates eye activity data and generates an estimate of drowsiness.
The assembly comprises a pantograph which can move relative to the carbody of the rail vehicle on which it is assembled.
A tilting train is a train which uses a built-in device to create an additional superelevation in addition to the cant of the track in curve negotiation.
This means that the pantograph follows the bogie movements at all times, and remains unaffected by the tilting rotation applied to the carbody of the vehicle.
Such movements, in comparison to tilting movements which are quasi-static, come about when the vehicle is in motion and their frequency content is higher.
It relates to its bogie by means of a flexible transmission rope which transmits tilting movements of the carbody to the platform.
The core inside the flexible transmission rope can shift in linear movements with respect to its sheath, and work by traction only or by traction and compression.
The flexible transmission rope or ropes shall consist of a sheath or sleeve, and a core which is free to move around with respect to the sheath.
The device consists of a casing and a rod, both of which are coupled and can move telescopically between each other.
This device may be used to transmit the tilting movement between the bogie frame and the bogie bolster to the core of the flexible transmission rope.
The sheath of the flexible transmission shaft is anchored by nuts to casing, whilst the core inside the flexible transmission shaft it attached to the nut.
In the repair of highways, it is often necessary to close lanes of a highway and reroute traffic onto other lanes to permit the closed lanes to be repaired.
It is an object of the invention to provide a less labor intensive and quicker way to remove temporary highway marking tape.
Further illustratively according to the invention, the lower section is movable to position the lower section in a non-use orientation on top of the center section.
Illustratively according to the invention, the apparatus further comprises a carriage for movably supporting the mast from the road frame.
The tape is then fed upward along lower section over a roller fairlead and over a roller mounted adjacent pivot.
Until now, the removal of the tape has been performed manually, with the repair crew walking the section of repaired highway and pulling the temporary marking tape up in short sections.
A double acting hydraulic cylinder motor is mounted at one of its ends to the road frame.
The upper section extends from the center section in a direction generally opposite the lower section when both the lower section and the upper section are in use orientations.
A drive sprocket at the end of shaft opposite sprocket and a companion sprocket at an end of roller are coupled together by a roller drive chain.
This tape can then be removed from the repaired section of highway after the repair is complete and discarded.
In most cases, the reason to identify drug-impaired individuals participating in public traffic is motivated by safety issues and legal implications caused by these individuals operating cars, machinery or other equipment.
The detection of drug vapors or vapors resulting from metabolization of drugs in the human body in traffic and traffic-related situations, although of great importance, is a much less explored field.
However, the prior art for detectors useful for detecting drugs, or the metabolized by-products of drug ingestion, is even less well-developed than the prior art for alcohol detectors.
Reference is now made in detail to a specific embodiment of the present invention, which illustrates the best mode presently contemplated by the inventors for practicing the invention.
Once a drug has been detected inside the vehicle, there are a wide variety of options concerning how this information can be used.
They are based on the principle of absorption enhancement inside a laser resonator taking advantage of high absorption gain achieved within small sample volumes.
Choosing the appropriate spectral region for drug detection is critical to achieve high sensitivity and to avoid interference with other airborne species present in a vehicle.
This approach has been studied in detail experimentally and theoretically for its applicability to ILS measurements and complies with requirements outlined in previous paragraphs.
Thus, there has been disclosed an on-board drug sensor for detection of drugs and metabolized by-product vapors in vehicular cabins.
On the other hand, exhaled metabolites are known for other drugs, such as alcohol, in which the exhaled metabolites include acetaldehyde and acetic acid.
