# DocOIE: A Document-level Context-Aware Dataset for OpenIE

DocOIE: **Doc**ument-level context-aware **O**pen **I**nformation **E**xtraction

## Introduction
DocOIE is a document-level context-aware dataset for Open Information Extraction.
DocIE is a context-aware Open Information Extraction Model.
The details of this work are elaborated in our paper published in [Findings of ACL 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04271).

## DocOIE dataset
DocOIE consists of evaluation and training dataset.

**Evaluation dataset** ``\DocOIE\data_evaluation\`` contains 800 expert-annotated sentences, sampled from 80 documents in two domains (healthcare and transportation).


**Training dataset**  ``\DocOIE\data_train\`` contains 2,400 documents from the two domains (healthcare and transportation); 1,200 documents in each domain. All sentences from these documents are used to bootstrap pseudo labels for neural model training.  
**Note**: Only document IDs are included in DocOIE Training dataset, for document collection at [PatFT](http://patft.uspto.gov/).
